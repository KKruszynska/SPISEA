	Abstract = {We now know that a large number of stars are born in multiple systems. Additionally, more than 70% of massive stars are found in close binary systems, meaning that they will interact over the course of their lifetime. This has strong implications for their evolution as well as the transients (e.g supernovae) and the potential gravitational wave progenitors they produce. Therefore, in order to understand and correctly interpret astronomical observations of stellar populations, we must use theoretical models able to account for the effects of binary stars. This is the case of the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code (BPASS), which has been a staple of the field for over 10 years. As is the case for most other theoretical models, the data products of BPASS are large, varied and complex. As a result, their use requires a level of expertise that is not immediately accessible to a wider community that may hold key observational data. The goal of hoki is to bridge the gap between observation and theory, by providing a set of tools to make BPASS data easily accessible and facilitate analysis. The use of Python is deliberate as it is a ubiquitous language within Astronomy. This allows BPASS results to be used naturally within the pre-existing workflow of most astronomers.},

	Abstract = {We present numerical models of the nebular emission from H II regions around young stellar populations over a range of compositions and ages. The synthetic stellar populations include both single stars and interacting binary stars. We compare these models to the observed emission lines of 254 H II regions of 13 nearby spiral galaxies and 21 dwarf galaxies drawn from archival data. The models are created using the combination of the BPASS (Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis) code with the photoionization code CLOUDY to study the differences caused by the inclusion of interacting binary stars in the stellar population. We obtain agreement with the observed emission line ratios from the nearby star-forming regions and discuss the effect of binary-star evolution pathways on the nebular ionization of H II regions. We find that at population ages above 10 Myr, single-star models rapidly decrease in flux and ionization strength, while binary-star models still produce strong flux and high [O III]/H β ratios. Our models can reproduce the metallicity of H II regions from spiral galaxies, but we find higher metallicities than previously estimated for the H II regions from dwarf galaxies. Comparing the equivalent width of H β emission between models and observations, we find that accounting for ionizing photon leakage can affect age estimates for H II regions. When it is included, the typical age derived for H II regions is 5 Myr from single-star models, and up to 10 Myr with binary-star models. This is due to the existence of binary-star evolution pathways, which produce more hot Wolf-Rayet and helium stars at older ages. For future reference, we calculate new BPASS binary maximal starburst lines as a function of metallicity, and for the total model population, and present these in Appendix A.},

@article{Devriendt:1999sn,
	Abstract = {We present STARDUST, a new self-consistent modelling of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies from far-UV to radio wavelengths. In order to derive the SEDs in this broad spectral range, we first couple spectrophotometric and (closed-box) chemical evolutions to account for metallicity effects on the spectra of synthetic stellar populations. We briefly compare the UV/visible/near-IR colours and magnitudes predicted by our code with those of other codes available in the literature and we find an overall agreement, in spite of differences in the stellar data. We then use a phenomenological fit for the metal-dependent extinction curve and a simple geometric distribution of the dust to compute the optical depth of galaxies and the corresponding obscuration curve. This enables us to calculate the fraction of stellar light reprocessed in the infrared range. In a final step, we define a dust model with various components and we fix the weights of these components in order to reproduce the IRAS correlation of IR colours with total IR luminosities. This allows us to compute far-IR SEDs that phenomenologically mimic observed trends. We are able to predict the spectral evolution of galaxies in a broad wavelength range, and we can reproduce the observed SEDs of local spirals, starbursts, luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). This modelling is so far kept as simple as possible and depends on a small number of free parameters, namely the initial mass function (IMF), star formation rate (SFR) time scale, gas density, and galaxy age, as well as on more refined assumptions on dust properties and the presence (or absence) of gas inflows/outflows. However, these SEDs will be subsequently implemented in a semi-analytic approach of galaxy formation, where most of the free parameters can be consistently computed from more general assumptions for the physical processes ruling galaxy formation and evolution.},

@article{GRAVITY-Collaboration:2020ro,
	Abstract = {The star S2 orbiting the compact radio source Sgr A* is a precision probe of the gravitational field around the closest massive black hole (candidate). Over the last 2.7 decades we have monitored the star's radial velocity and motion on the sky, mainly with the SINFONI and NACO adaptive optics (AO) instruments on the ESO VLT, and since 2017, with the four-telescope interferometric beam combiner instrument GRAVITY. In this paper we report the first detection of the General Relativity (GR) Schwarzschild Precession (SP) in S2's orbit. Owing to its highly elliptical orbit (e = 0.88), S2's SP is mainly a kink between the pre-and post-pericentre directions of motion ~ +- 1 year around pericentre passage, relative to the corresponding Kepler orbit. The superb 2017-2019 astrometry of GRAVITY defines the pericentre passage and outgoing direction. The incoming direction is anchored by 118 NACO-AO measurements of S2's position in the infrared reference frame, with an additional 75 direct measurements of the S2-Sgr A* separation during bright states ('flares') of Sgr A*. Our 14-parameter model fits for the distance, central mass, the position and motion of the reference frame of the AO astrometry relative to the mass, the six parameters of the orbit, as well as a dimensionless parameter f_SP for the SP (f_SP = 0 for Newton and 1 for GR). From data up to the end of 2019 we robustly detect the SP of S2, del phi = 12' per orbital period. From posterior fitting and MCMC Bayesian analysis with different weighting schemes and bootstrapping we find f_SP = 1.10 +- 0.19. The S2 data are fully consistent with GR. Any extended mass inside S2's orbit cannot exceed ~ 0.1% of the central mass. Any compact third mass inside the central arcsecond must be less than about 1000 M_sun.},

@article{Dolphin:2002ho,
	Abstract = {A comprehensive study of the measurement of star formation histories from colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) is presented, with an emphasis on a variety of subtle issues involved in the generation of model CMDs and maximum likelihood solution. Among these are the need for a complete sampling of the synthetic CMD, the use of proper statistics for dealing with Poisson-distributed data (and a demonstration of why χ <SUP>2</SUP> must not be used), measuring full uncertainties in all reported parameters, quantifying the goodness-of-fit, and questions of binning the CMD and incorporating outside information. Several example star formation history measurements are given. Two examples involve synthetic data, in which the input and recovered parameters can be compared to locate possible flaws in the methodology (none were apparent) and measure the accuracy with which ages, metallicities and star formation rates can be recovered. Solutions of the histories of seven Galactic dwarf spheroidal companions (Carina, Draco, Leo I, Leo II, Sagittarius, Sculptor and Ursa Minor) illustrate the ability to measure star formation histories given a variety of conditions - numbers of stars, complexity of star formation history and amount of foreground contamination. Significant measurements of ancient &gt;8Gyr star formation are made in all seven galaxies. Sculptor, Draco and Ursa Minor appear entirely ancient, while the other systems show varying amounts of younger stars.},

	Abstract = {Star clusters have long been used to illuminate both stellar evolution and Galactic evolution. They also hold clues to the chemical and nucleosynthetic processes throughout the history of the Galaxy. We have taken high signal-to-noise (S/N), high-resolution spectra of 11 solar-type stars in the Praesepe open cluster to determine the chemical abundances of 16 elements: Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ni, Y, and Ba. We have determined Fe from Fe I and Fe II lines and find [Fe/H] = +0.12 $\pm$0.04. We find that Li decreases with temperature due to increasing Li depletion in cooler stars; it matches the Li-temperature pattern found in the Hyades. The [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] abundances are below solar and lower than the field star samples due to the younger age of Praesepe (0.7 Gyr) than the field stars. The alpha-elements, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, have solar ratios with respect to Fe, and are also lower than the field star samples. The Fe-peak elements, Cr and Ni, track Fe and have solar values. The neutron capture element [Y/Fe] is found to be solar, but [Ba/Fe] is enhanced relative to solar and to the field stars. Three Praesepe giants were studied by Carrera and Pancino; they are apparently enhanced in Na, Mg, and Ba relative to the Praesepe dwarfs. The Na enhancement may indicate proton-capture nucleosynthesis in the Ne → Na cycling with dredge-up into the atmospheres of the red giants.},

	Abstract = {We present 24 μm photometry of the intermediate-age open cluster Praesepe. We assemble a catalog of 193 probable cluster members that are detected in optical databases, the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and at 24 μm, within an area of ~2.47 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. Mid-IR excesses indicating debris disks are found for one early-type and for three solar-type stars. Corrections for sampling statistics yield a 24 μm excess fraction (debris disk fraction) of 6.5% $\pm$ 4.1% for luminous and 1.9% $\pm$ 1.2% for solar-type stars. The incidence of excesses is in agreement with the decay trend of debris disks as a function of age observed for other cluster and field stars. The values also agree with those for older stars, indicating that debris generation in the zones that emit at 24 μm falls to the older 1-10 Gyr field star sample value by roughly 750 Myr. We discuss our results in the context of previous observations of excess fractions for early- and solar-type stars. We show that solar-type stars lose their debris disk 24 μm excesses on a shorter timescale than early-type stars. Simplistic Monte Carlo models suggest that, during the first Gyr of their evolution, up to 15%-30% of solar-type stars might undergo an orbital realignment of giant planets such as the one thought to have led to the Late Heavy Bombardment, if the length of the bombardment episode is similar to the one thought to have happened in our solar system. In the Appendix, we determine the cluster's parameters via bootstrap Monte Carlo isochrone fitting, yielding an age of 757 Myr ($\pm$36 Myr at 1σ confidence) and a distance of 179 pc ($\pm$2 pc at 1σ confidence), not allowing for systematic errors.},

	Abstract = {From histories of reddening studies for the Hyades, Praesepe, and nearby field stars, it is concluded that reddening scholarship requires fundamental reform. The adopted protocol for the reformed version of scholarship includes (1) rigorous published foundations for reddening values, (2) explicit quality control of reddening techniques, (3) use of techniques with limited metallicity sensitivity, (4) explicit zero-point control for both input data and derived reddening values, (5) an explicit choice of a reddening zero point, and (6) adherence to statistical norms. It is argued that only limited use should be made of reddening values from (1) spectral types for F0 and later type stars, (2) UBV analysis of blanketed stars, and (3) certain published relations between reddening and distance. However, reddening values may be based safely on (1) polarization measurements, (2) comparisons of β and (R-I)<SUB>C</SUB> for F stars, and (3) Str{\"o}mgren β analysis of A stars. For the Hyades and Coma, upper 95% confidence limits on E(B-V) are found to be &lt;=1.0 and &lt;=3.2 mmag, respectively. For Praesepe, the derived value of E(B-V) is 27+/-4 mmag. The latter result is obtained after an allowance is made for the effects of an anomalous relation between b-y and (R-I)<SUB>C</SUB> in Praesepe A stars. A test of the possibility that differential stellar rotation causes the anomaly yields an inconclusive result. Adoption of the revised reddening value instead of the canonical value of zero yields an increase in the derived Praesepe distance modulus by 0.14 mag and a decrease in the derived cluster age by about 11%. In addition, by using published high-dispersion results, it is found that the value of [Fe/H] for Praesepe that is consistent with the derived reddening value is +0.01+/-0.04 dex. Further results for Praesepe stars will be required for a definitive comparison of the Hyades and Praesepe metallicities.},

	Abstract = {The Hyades, Praesepe, and Pleiades are well-studied stellar clusters that anchor important secondary stellar age indicators. Recent studies have shown that main sequence turn off based ages for these clusters may depend on the degree of rotation in the underlying stellar models. Rotation induces structural instabilities that can enhance the chemical mixing of a star, extending its fuel supply. In addition, rotation introduces a modulation of the star's observed magnitude and color due to the effects of gravity darkening. We aim to investigate the extent to which stellar rotation affects the age determination of star clusters. We utilize the MESA stellar evolution code to create models that cover a range of rotation rates corresponding to Ω/Ω<SUB>c</SUB> = 0.0-0.6 in 0.1 dex steps, allowing the assessment of variations in this dimension. The statistical analysis package, MATCH, is employed to derive ages and metallicities by fitting our MESA models to Tycho B <SUB> T </SUB>, V <SUB> T </SUB>, and 2MASS J, K <SUB> s </SUB> color-magnitude diagrams. We find that the derived ages are relatively insensitive to the effects of rotation. For the Hyades, Praesepe, and Pleiades clusters, we derive ages based on synthetic populations that model a distribution of rotation rates or a fixed rate. Across each case, the derived ages tend to agree roughly within errors, near 680, 590, and 110-160 Myr for the Hyades, Praesepe, and Pleiades clusters, respectively. These ages are in agreement with Li depletion boundary-based ages and previous analyses that used nonrotating isochrones. Our methods do not provide a strong constraint on the metallicities of these clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a stellar membership survey of the nearby open clusters Praesepe and Coma Berenices. We have combined archival survey data from the SDSS, 2MASS, USNOB1.0, and UCAC-2.0 surveys to compile proper motions and photometry for ~5 million sources over 300 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. Of these sources, 1010 stars in Praesepe and 98 stars in Coma Ber are identified as candidate members with probability &gt;80% 442 and 61 are identified as high-probability candidates for the first time. We estimate that this survey is &gt;90% complete across a wide range of spectral types (F0-M5 in Praesepe, F5-M6 in Coma Ber). We have also investigated the stellar mass dependence of each cluster's mass and radius in order to quantify the role of mass segregation and tidal stripping in shaping the present-day mass function and spatial distribution of stars. Praesepe shows clear evidence of mass segregation across the full stellar mass range; Coma Ber does not show any clear trend, but low number statistics would mask a trend of the same magnitude as in Praesepe. The mass function for Praesepe (τ ~ 600 Myr; M ~ 500 M<SUB>odot</SUB>) follows a power law consistent with that of the field present-day mass function, suggesting that any mass-dependent tidal stripping could have removed only the lowest mass members (&lt;0.15 M<SUB>odot</SUB>). Coma Ber, which is younger but much less massive (τ ~ 400 Myr; M ~ 100 M<SUB>odot</SUB>), follows a significantly shallower power law. This suggests that some tidal stripping has occurred, but the low-mass stellar population has not been strongly depleted down to the survey completeness limit (~0.12 M<SUB>odot</SUB>).},

	Abstract = {Over the past decades open clusters have been the subject of many studies. Such studies are crucial considering that the universality of the initial mass function is still a subject of current investigations. Praesepe is an interesting open cluster for the study of the stellar and substellar mass function (MF), considering its intermediate age and its nearby distance. Here we present the results of a wide-field, near-infrared study of Praesepe using the Data Release 9 of the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope Infrared Deep Sky Survey Galactic Clusters Survey. We obtained cluster candidates of Praesepe based on a 3σ astrometric and five-band photometric selection. We derived a binary frequency for Praesepe of 25.6 $\pm$ 3.0 per cent in the 0.2-0.45 M<SUB>☉</SUB> mass range, 19.6 $\pm$ 3.0 per cent for 0.1-0.2 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and 23.2 $\pm$ 5.6 per cent for 0.07-0.1 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. We also studied the variability of the cluster candidates of Praesepe, and we conclude that seven objects could be variable. We inferred the luminosity function of Praesepe in the Z and J bands and derived its MF. We observe that our determination of the MF of Praesepe differs from previous studies: while previous MFs present an increase from 0.6 to 0.1 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, our MF shows a decrease. We looked at the MF of Praesepe in two different regions of the cluster, i.e. within and beyond 1$\,^{\circ}$.25, and we observed that both regions present an MF which decrease to lower masses. We compared our results with the Hyades, the Pleiades and α Per MF in the mass range 0.072-0.6 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and showed that the Praesepe MF is more similar to α Per although they are, respectively, of ages ∼85 and ∼600 Myr. Even though of similar age, the Praesepe remains different than the Hyades, with a decrease in the MF of only ∼0.2 dex from 0.6 down to 0.1 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, compared to ∼1 dex for the Hyades. Based on observations made with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, operated by the Joint Astronomy Centre on behalf of the UK Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council.},

	Abstract = {Membership identification is the first step in determining the properties of a star cluster. Low-mass members in particular could be used to trace the dynamical history, such as mass segregation, stellar evaporation, or tidal stripping, of a star cluster in its Galactic environment. We identified member candidates of the intermediate-age Praesepe cluster (M44) with stellar masses ~0.11-2.4 M <SUB>☉</SUB>, using Panoramic Survey Telescope And Rapid Response System and Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry, and PPMXL proper motions. Within a sky area of 3$\,^{\circ}$ radius, 1040 candidates are identified, of which 96 are new inclusions. Using the same set of selection criteria on field stars, an estimated false positive rate of 16% was determined, suggesting that 872 of the candidates are true members. This most complete and reliable membership list allows us to favor the BT-Settl model over other stellar models. The cluster shows a distinct binary track above the main sequence, with a binary frequency of 20%-40%, and a high occurrence rate of similar mass pairs. The mass function is consistent with that of the disk population but shows a deficit of members below 0.3 solar masses. A clear mass segregation is evidenced, with the lowest-mass members in our sample being evaporated from this disintegrating cluster.},

	Abstract = {We present an extinction map of the inner $\sim$\SI 15  \arcminute  by  16  \arcminute  of the Galactic Center (GC) with map `pixels' measuring \SI 5  \arcsecond  $\times$ \SI 5  \arcsecond  using integrated light color measurements in the near- and mid-infrared. We use a variant of the Rayleigh-Jeans Color Excess (RJCE) method first described by Majewski et al. (2011) as the basis of our work, although we have approached our problem with a Bayesian mindset and dispensed with point-source photometry in favor of surface photometry, turning the challenge of the extremely crowded field at the GC into an advantage. Our results show that extinction at the GC is not inconsistent with a single power law coefficient, $\beta=2.03\pm0.06$, and compare our results with those using the Red Clump (RC) point-source photometry method of extinction estimation. We find that our measurement of $\beta$ and its apparent lack of spatial variation are in agreement with prior studies, despite the bimodal distribution of values in our extinction map at the GC with peaks at \num 5  and \SI 7.5  mag . This bimodal nature of extinction is likely due to the InfraRed Dark Clouds that obscure portions of the inner GC field. We present our extinction law and map and de-reddened NIR CMDs and color-color diagram of the GC region using the point-source catalog of IR sources compiled by DeWitt et al. (2010). The de-reddening is limited by the error in the extinction measurement (typically \SI 0.6  mag ), which is affected by the size of our map pixels and is not fine-grained enough to separate out the multiple stellar populations present toward the GC.},

	Abstract = {New detailed stellar yields of several elemental species are derived for massive stars in a wide range of masses (from 6 to 120 M<SUB>sun</SUB>) and metallicities (Z =0.0004, 0.004, 0.008, 0.02, 0.05). Our calculations are based on the Padova evolutionary tracks and take into account recent results on stellar evolution, such as overshooting and quiescent mass-loss, paying major attention to the effects of the initial chemical composition of the star. We finally include modern results on explosive nucleosynthesis in SN\ae\ by Woosley &amp; Weaver (1995). The issue of the chemical yields of Very Massive Objects (from 120 to 1000 M<SUB>sun</SUB>) is also addressed. Our grid of stellar yields for massive stars is complementary to the results by Marigo  et al. (1996, 1998) on the evolution and nucleosynthesis of low and intermediate mass stars, also based on the Padova evolutionary tracks. Altogether, they represent a complete set of stellar yields of unprecedented homogeneity and self-consistency. Our new stellar yields are inserted in a code for the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc with infall of primordial gas, according to the formulation first suggested by Talbot &amp; Arnett (1971, 1973, 1975) and Chiosi (1980). As a first application, the code is used to develop a model of the chemical evolution of the Solar Vicinity, with a detailed comparison to the available observational constraints.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we show that the supernova remnant (SNR) masses accumulated from core-collapse supernovae (SNe) along the star formation history of two powerful z = 3.8 radio galaxies, 4C41.17 and TN J2007-1316, reach up to ≥slant   10 <SUP>9</SUP>    M <SUB>☉ </SUB> , which is comparable to supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses measured from the SDSS sample at similar redshifts. The SNR mass is measured from the already exploded SN mass after subtraction of ejecta while the mass of still luminous stars fits at best the observed spectral energy distribution, continuously extended to the optical-Spitzer-Herschel-submm domains, with the help of the galaxy evolution model P{\'e}gase.3. For recent and old stellar populations, SNR masses vary about 10<SUP>9-10</SUP>   M <SUB>☉ </SUB>  and the SNR-to-star mass ratio between 1% and 0.1% is comparable to the observed low-z SMBH-to-star mass ratio. For the template radio galaxy 4C41.17, SNR and stellar population masses estimated from large aperture (&gt;4 arcsec = 30 kpc) observations are compatible, within one order of mass, with the total mass of multiple optical Hubble Space Telescope (700 pc) structures associated with VLA radio emissions, both at 0.1 arcsec. Probing the SNR accretion fueling central black holes is a simple explanation for SMBH growth, which requires the physics of star formation and stellar and galaxy dynamics with consequences for various processes (quenching, mergers, negative feedback) and is also a key to the bulge-SMBH relation.},

	Abstract = {We study the role of massive perturbers (MPs) in deflecting stars and binaries to almost radial (``loss cone'') orbits, where they pass near the central massive black hole (MBH), interact with it at periapse, and are ultimately destroyed. MPs dominate dynamical relaxation when the ratio of the second moments of the MP and star mass distributions, μ<SUB>2</SUB>≡N<SUB>p</SUB>&lt;M<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>p</SUB>&gt;/N<SUB>*</SUB>&lt;M<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>*</SUB>&gt;, satisfies μ<SUB>2</SUB>&gt;&gt;1. We compile the MP mass function from published observations and show that MPs in the nucleus of the Galaxy (mainly giant molecular clouds), and plausibly in late-type galaxies generally, have 10<SUP>2</SUP>&lt;~μ<SUB>2</SUB>&lt;~10<SUP>8</SUP>. MPs thus shorten the relaxation timescale by 10<SUP>1</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> relative to two-body relaxation by stars alone. We show that this increases by 10<SUP>1</SUP>-10<SUP>3</SUP> the rate of large-periapse interactions with the MBH, where loss cone refilling by stellar two-body relaxation is inefficient. We extend the Fokker-Planck loss cone formalism to approximately account for relaxation by rare encounters with MPs. We show that binary star-MBH exchanges driven by MPs can explain the origin of the young main-sequence B stars that are observed very near the Galactic MBH and can increase by orders of magnitude the ejection rate of hypervelocity stars. In contrast, the rate of small-periapse interactions of single stars with the MBH, such as tidal disruption, is only increased by a factor of a few. We suggest that MP-driven relaxation plays an important role in the three-body exchange capture of stars on very tight orbits around the MBH. These captured stars may later be disrupted by the MBH via tidal orbital decay or direct scattering into the loss cone; captured compact objects may inspiral into the MBH by the emission of gravitational waves from zero-eccentricity orbits.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new way to search for hypervelocity stars (HVS) in the Galactic bulge, by using red clump (RC) giants, that are good distance indicators. The second Gaia Data Release and the near-IR data from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) Survey led to the selection of a volume limited sample of 34 bulge RC stars. A search in this combined data set leads to the discovery of seven candidate hypervelocity red clump stars in the Milky Way bulge. Based on this search we estimate the total production rate of hypervelocity RC stars from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) to be N <SUB>HVRC</SUB> = 3.26 × 10<SUP>−4</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP>. This opens up the possibility of finding larger samples of HVS in the Galactic bulge using future surveys, closer to their main production site, if they originated from interactions of binaries with the central SMBH. <P />Based on observations taken within the ESO programs 179.B-2002, and 198.B-2004.},

	Abstract = {Hypervelocity stars are believed to be ejected out from the Galactic center (GC) through dynamical interactions of (binary) stars with the central massive black hole(s). In this Letter, we report 13 metal-poor F-type hypervelocity star candidates selected from 370,000 stars of the data release 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With a detailed analysis of the kinematics of these stars, we find that seven of them were likely ejected from the GC or the Galactic disk, four neither originated from the GC nor the Galactic disk, and the other two were possibly ejected from either the Galactic disk or other regions. Those candidates that unlikely originated from the GC or the Galactic disk may be explained by other mechanisms, like the tidal disruption of the Milky Way's dwarf galaxies in the Galactic potential, or the gravitational interactions with a massive black hole at the center of M31 or M32.},

Our limits are a factor of 3-10 more stringent than previously reported, depending on stellar type. Compared to the known population of B-star ejectees, there can be no more than 30 times more metal-rich old-population F/G stars ejected from the GC. Because B stars comprise a tiny fraction of a normal stellar population, this places significant limits on the combination of the GC mass function and the ejection mechanism for HVSs. In the presence of a normal GC mass function, our results require an ejection mechanism that is about 5.5 times more efficient at ejecting B stars compared to low-mass F/G stars.},

	Abstract = {To date, all of the reported hypervelocity stars (HVSs), which are believed to be ejected from the Galactic center, are blue and therefore almost certainly young. Old-population HVSs could be much more numerous than the young ones that have been discovered, but still have escaped detection because they are hidden in a much denser background of Galactic halo stars. Discovery of these stars would shed light on star formation at the Galactic center, would constrain the mechanism by which they are ejected from it, and, if they prove numerous, would enable detailed studies of the structure of the dark halo. We analyze the problem of finding these stars and show that the search should be concentrated around the main-sequence turnoff (0.3&lt;g-i&lt;1.1) at relatively faint magnitudes (19.5&lt;g&lt;21.5). If the ratio of turnoff stars to B stars is the same for HVSs as it is in the local disk, such a search would yield about 1 old-population HVS per 45 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. A telescope similar to the Sloan 2.5 m could search about 20 deg<SUP>2</SUP> per night, implying that such a population, should it exist, would show up in interesting numbers in short order.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate the existence of an enhanced rate of angular momentum relaxation in nearly Keplerian star clusters, such as those found in the centers of galactic nuclei containing massive black holes. The enhanced relaxation arises because the radial and azimuthal orbital frequencies in a Keplerian potential are equal, and hence may be termed resonant relaxation. We explore the dynamics of resonant relaxation using both numerical simulations and order-of-magnitude analytic calculations. We find that the resonant angular momentum relaxation time is shorter than the non-resonant relaxation time by of order M<SUB>★</SUB>/ M, where M<SUB>★</SUB> is the mass in stars and M is the mass of the central object. Resonance does not enhance the energy relaxation rate. We examine the effect of resonant relaxation on the rate of tidal disruption of stars by the central mass; we find that the flux of stars into the loss cone is enhanced when the loss cone is empty, but that the disruption rate averaged over the entire cluster is not strongly affected. We show that relativistic precession can disable resonant relaxation near the main-sequence loss cone for black hole masses comparable to those in galactic nuclei. Resonant dynamical friction leads to growth or decay of the eccentricity of the orbit of a massive body, depending on whether the distribution function of the stars is predominantly radial or tangential. The accelerated relaxation implies that there are regions in nuclear star clusters that are relaxed in angular momentum but not in energy; unfortunately, these regions are not well-resolved in most nearby galaxies by the Hubble Space Telescope.

	Abstract = {We estimate the distribution of ejection velocities for the known population of high Galactic latitude runaway stars. The initial sample is a collection of 174 early-type stars selected from the literature. The stars are first classified according to their evolutionary status in order to obtain a homogeneous sample of 96 genuine main-sequence stars. Their present velocities and flight times are then estimated using proper motion data from various astrometric catalogues (including Tycho-2, UCAC2 and USNO-B) and the ejection velocities are computed by tracing their orbits back in time, based on a Galactic potential. The potential used is constructed from a mass density model chosen to fit the most recent observational constraints. <P />We find evidence for two different populations of runaway stars: a 'high' velocity population, with a maximum ejection velocity of about 400-500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and a 'low' velocity population, with a maximum ejection velocity of about 300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We argue that the observed limit of 500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and the bimodality of the observed ejection velocity distribution are natural consequences of the so-called Binary Ejection Mechanism. We discuss the connection between the 'high' velocity population and the so-called hypervelocity stars, showing how previously studied hypervelocity stars are consistent with the results obtained. <P />We also find that some stars that were once thought to be best explained as being formed in the halo are compatible with a runaway hypothesis once proper motions are included in the analysis. However, three stars in the selected sample appear to be inconsistent with ejection from the Galactic disc. Possible scenarios are discussed, including a possible formation in the Galactic halo.},

	Abstract = {Our Galactic Center contains young stars, including the few million year old clockwise disk of O and B stars between 0.05 pc to 0.5 pc from the Galactic Center, and the S--star cluster of early B--type stars at a galactocentric distance of ~0.01 pc. Recent observations suggest the S--stars are remnants of tidally disrupted binaries from the clockwise disk. In particular, Koposov et al. 2020 recently discovered a hypervelocity star that was ejected from the Galactic Center five million years ago with a velocity vector that is consistent with this disk. We perform a detailed study of this scenario. First, we quantify the plausible range of binary semi--major axes in the clockwise disk. We find that the dynamical evaporation of such binaries is dominated by other disk stars rather than more numerous old, isotropic stellar population. For the expected range of binary semi--major axes in the clockwise disk, binary tidal disruptions (also known as the Hills mechanism) can reproduce the observed S--star semi--major axis distribution. Reproducing the observed thermal eccentricity distribution of the S--stars requires an additional relaxation process. The flight time of the recently discovered hypervelocity star from the Galactic Center and the most recent constraints on the S--stars' ages both suggest this process has to be effective within ten million years. We consider three possibilities: (i) scalar resonant relaxation from the surrounding isotropic star cluster (ii) torques from the clockwise disk, and (iii) an intermediate mass black hole. We conclude that only the latter would be fast enough to reproduce the observed S--star eccentricity distribution. Finally, we show that the primary star from an unequal mass binary would be deposited at larger semi--major axes than the secondary, possibly explaining the dearth of O stars among the S--stars.},

	Abstract = {We present stellar metallicity measurements of more than 600 late-type stars in the central 10 pc of the Galactic centre. Together with our previously published KMOS data, this data set allows us to investigate, for the first time, spatial variations of the nuclear star cluster's metallicity distribution. Using the integral-field spectrograph KMOS (VLT) we observed almost half of the area enclosed by the nuclear star cluster's effective radius. We extract spectra at medium spectral resolution, and apply full spectral fitting utilising the PHOENIX library of synthetic stellar spectra. The stellar metallicities range from [M/H]=-1.25 dex to [M/H]> +0.3 dex, with most of the stars having super-solar metallicity. We are able to measure an anisotropy of the stellar metallicity distribution. In the Galactic North, the portion of sub-solar metallicity stars with [M/H]<0.0 dex is more than twice as high as in the Galactic South. One possible explanation for different fractions of sub-solar metallicity stars in different parts of the cluster is a recent merger event. We propose to test this hypothesis with high-resolution spectroscopy, and by combining the metallicity information with kinematic data.},

	Abstract = {We show that dynamical evolution in a strong (Galactic Centre-like) tidal field can create clusters that would appear to have very top-heavy IMFs. The tidal disruption of single star forming events can leave several bound `clusters' spread along 20 pc of the orbit within 1-2 Myr. These surviving (sub)clusters tend to contain an over-abundance of massive stars, with low-mass stars tending to be spread along the whole `tidal arm'. Therefore observing a cluster in a strong tidal field with a top-heavy IMF might well not mean the stars formed with a top-heavy IMF.},

	Abstract = {We report ALMA observations with resolution ≈0.″5 at 3 mm of the extended Sgr B2 cloud in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). We detect 271 compact sources, most of which are smaller than 5000 au. By ruling out alternative possibilities, we conclude that these sources consist of a mix of hypercompact H II regions and young stellar objects (YSOs). Most of the newly detected sources are YSOs with gas envelopes that, based on their luminosities, must contain objects with stellar masses  M <SUB>* </SUB>≳ 8  M <SUB>☉ </SUB>. Their spatial distribution spread over a ̃12 × 3 pc region demonstrates that Sgr B2 is experiencing an extended star formation event, not just an isolated ``starburst'' within the protocluster regions. Using this new sample, we examine star formation thresholds and surface density relations in Sgr B2. While all of the YSOs reside in regions of high column density (N(   H   <SUB>2</SUB>)≳ 2×  10 <SUP>23</SUP>  cm  <SUP>-2</SUP>), not all regions of high column density contain YSOs. The observed column density threshold for star formation is substantially higher than that in solar vicinity clouds, implying either that high-mass star formation requires a higher column density or that any star formation threshold in the CMZ must be higher than in nearby clouds. The relation between the surface density of gas and stars is incompatible with extrapolations from local clouds, and instead stellar densities in Sgr B2 follow a linear    Σ    <SUB>* </SUB> --    Σ    <SUB>gas</SUB>  relation, shallower than that observed in local clouds. Together, these points suggest that a higher volume density threshold is required to explain star formation in CMZ clouds.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we provide a comprehensive description of the internal dynamics of G0.253+0.016 (a.k.a. `the Brick'); one of the most massive and dense molecular clouds in the Galaxy to lack signatures of widespread star formation. As a potential host to a future generation of high-mass stars, understanding largely quiescent molecular clouds like G0.253+0.016 is of critical importance. In this paper, we reanalyse Atacama Large Millimeter Array cycle 0 HNCO J = 4(0, 4) - 3(0, 3) data at 3 mm, using two new pieces of software that we make available to the community. First, SCOUSEPY, a Python implementation of the spectral line fitting algorithm SCOUSE. Secondly, ACORNS (Agglomerative Clustering for ORganising Nested Structures), a hierarchical n-dimensional clustering algorithm designed for use with discrete spectroscopic data. Together, these tools provide an unbiased measurement of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion in this cloud, σ _ v_  los , 1D =4.4$\pm$ 2.1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is somewhat larger than predicted by velocity dispersion-size relations for the central molecular zone (CMZ). The dispersion of centroid velocities in the plane of the sky are comparable, yielding σ _ v_  los , 1D /σ _ v_  pos , 1D ∼ 1.2$\pm$ 0.3. This isotropy may indicate that the line-of-sight extent of the cloud is approximately equivalent to that in the plane of the sky. Combining our kinematic decomposition with radiative transfer modelling, we conclude that G0.253+0.016 is not a single, coherent, and centrally condensed molecular cloud; `the Brick' is not a brick. Instead, G0.253+0.016 is a dynamically complex and hierarchically structured molecular cloud whose morphology is consistent with the influence of the orbital dynamics and shear in the CMZ.},

	Abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) with stellar masses of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB> and core stellar densities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> stars per cubic pc are thought to be the "missing link" between open clusters and extreme extragalactic super star clusters and globular clusters. As such, studying the initial conditions of YMCs offers an opportunity to test cluster formation models across the full cluster mass range. G0.253 + 0.016 is an excellent candidate YMC progenitor. We make use of existing multi-wavelength data including recently available far-IR continuum (Herschel/Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey) and mm spectral line (H<SUB>2</SUB>O Southern Galactic Plane Survey and Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz Survey) data and present new, deep, multiple-filter, near-IR (Very Large Telescope/NACO) observations to study G0.253 + 0.016. These data show that G0.253 + 0.016 is a high-mass (1.3 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB>), low-temperature (T <SUB>dust</SUB> ~ 20 K), high-volume, and column density (n ~ 8 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> N_ H_2  \sim 4\times 10^ 23  cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) molecular clump which is close to virial equilibrium (M <SUB>dust</SUB> ~ M <SUB>virial</SUB>) so is likely to be gravitationally bound. It is almost devoid of star formation and, thus, has exactly the properties expected for the initial conditions of a clump that may form an Arches-like massive cluster. We compare the properties of G0.253 + 0.016 to typical Galactic cluster-forming molecular clumps and find it is extreme, and possibly unique in the Galaxy. This uniqueness makes detailed studies of G0.253 + 0.016 extremely important for testing massive cluster formation models.},

	Abstract = {The nuclear disk is a dense stellar structure at the centre of the Milky Way, with a radius of 150 pc (ref. <SUP>1</SUP>). It has been a place of intense star formation in the past several tens of millions of years<SUP>1-3</SUP>, but its overall formation history has remained unknown<SUP>2</SUP>. Here, we report that the bulk of its stars formed at least 8 Gyr ago. After a long period of quiescence, a starburst event followed about 1 Gyr ago that formed roughly 5% of its mass within 100 Myr, in what may arguably have been one of the most energetic events in the history of the Milky Way. Star formation continued subsequently on a lower level, creating a few per cent of the stellar mass in the past 500 Myr, with an increased rate up to 30 Myr ago. Our findings contradict the previously accepted paradigm of quasi-continuous star formation at the Galactic Centre<SUP>4</SUP>. The long quiescent phase agrees with the overall quiescent history of the Milky Way<SUP>2,5</SUP> and suggests that our Galaxy's bar may not have existed until recently, or that gas transport through the bar was extremely inefficient during a long stretch of the Milky Way's life. Consequently, the central black hole may have acquired most of its mass already in the early days of the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {The properties of the orbits in a galaxy composed of an axisymmetric background and a weak bar are derived theoretically by means of an integral of motion besides the Hamiltonian. Inside the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) there is only one periodic orbit, while outside the resonance there are one unstable and two stable periodic orbits. The nonperiodic orbits surround one of the stable periodic orbits or both of them. Unless the amplitude of the wave increases considerably inwards, the orbits inside the ILR are oriented perpendicularly to the bar; the majority of the orbits outside the ILR and inside corotation are elongated along the bar, and the orbits outside corotation and inside the outer Lindblad resonance are oriented mainly perpendicularly to the bar. A comparison with numerical calculations of orbits in various models shows very good agreement.},

	Abstract = {We present new gas flow models for the Milky Way inside the solar circle. We use smoothed particles hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations in gravitational potentials determined from the near-infrared (NIR) luminosity distribution of the bulge and disc, assuming a constant NIR mass-to-light ratio, with an outer halo added in some cases. The luminosity models are based on the COBE/DIRBE maps and on clump giant star counts in several bulge fields and include a spiral arm model for the disc. <P />Gas flows in models that include massive spiral arms clearly match the observed <SUP>12</SUP>CO (l, v) diagram better than if the potential does not include spiral structure. Furthermore, models in which the luminous mass distribution and the gravitational potential of the Milky Way have four spiral arms are better fits to the observed (l, v) diagram than two-armed models. <P />Besides single-pattern speed models we investigate models with separate pattern speeds for the bar and spiral arms. The most important difference is that in the latter case the gas spiral arms go through the bar corotation region, keeping the gas aligned with the arms there. In the (l, v) plot this results in characteristic regions that appear to be nearly devoid of gas. In single-pattern speed models these regions are filled with gas because the spiral arms dissolve in the bar corotation region. <P />Comparing with the <SUP>12</SUP>CO data we find evidence for separate pattern speeds in the Milky Way. From a series of models the preferred range for the bar pattern speed is Ω<SUB>p</SUB>= 60 +/- 5 Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP>, corresponding to corotation at 3.4 +/- 0.3 kpc. The spiral pattern speed is less well constrained, but our preferred value is Ω<SUB>sp</SUB>~ 20 Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP>. A further series of gas models is computed for different bar angles, using separately determined luminosity models and gravitational potentials in each case. We find acceptable gas models for 20$\,^{\circ}$&lt;~ϕ<SUB>bar</SUB>&lt;~ 25$\,^{\circ}$. The model with (ϕ<SUB>bar</SUB>= 20$\,^{\circ}$, Ω<SUB>p</SUB>= 60 Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP>, Ω<SUB>sp</SUB>= 20 Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP>) gives an excellent fit to the spiral arm ridges in the observed (l, v) plot.},

	Abstract = {New large-scale CO surveys of the first and second Galactic quadrants and the nearby molecular cloud complexes in Orion and Taurus, obtained with the CfA 1.2 m telescope, have been combined with 31 other surveys obtained over the past two decades with that instrument and a similar telescope on Cerro Tololo in Chile, to produce a new composite CO survey of the entire Milky Way. The survey consists of 488,000 spectra that Nyquist or beamwidth (1/8deg) sample the entire Galactic plane over a strip 4<SUP>deg</SUP>-10<SUP>deg</SUP> wide in latitude, and beamwidth or 1/4deg sample nearly all large local clouds at higher latitudes. Compared with the previous composite CO survey of Dame et al. (1987), the new survey has 16 times more spectra, up to 3.4 times higher angular resolution, and up to 10 times higher sensitivity per unit solid angle. Each of the component surveys was integrated individually using clipping or moment masking to produce composite spatial and longitude-velocity maps of the Galaxy that display nearly all of the statistically significant emission in each survey but little noise. The composite maps provide detailed information on individual molecular clouds, suggest relationships between clouds and regions widely separated on the sky, and clearly display the main structural features of the molecular Galaxy. In addition, since the gas, dust, and Population I objects associated with molecular clouds contribute to the Galactic emission in every major wavelength band, the precise kinematic information provided by the present survey will form the foundation for many large-scale Galactic studies. A map of molecular column density predicted from complete and unbiased far-infrared and 21 cm surveys of the Galaxy was used both to determine the completeness of the present survey and to extrapolate it to the entire sky at |b|&lt;32<SUP>deg</SUP>. The close agreement of the observed and predicted maps implies that only ~2% of the total CO emission at |b|&lt;32<SUP>deg</SUP> lies outside our current sampling, mainly in the regions of Chamaeleon and the Gum Nebula. Taking into account this small amount of unobserved emission, the mean molecular column density decreases from ~3×10<SUP>20</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at |b|=5<SUP>deg</SUP> to ~0.1×10<SUP>20</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at |b|=30<SUP>deg</SUP> this drop is ~6 times steeper than would be expected from a plane-parallel layer, but is consistent with recent measurements of the mean molecular column density at higher latitudes. The ratio of the predicted molecular column density map to the observed CO intensity map provides a calibration of the CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> mass conversion factor X≡N<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>/W<SUB>CO</SUB>. Out of the Galactic plane (|b|&gt;5<SUP>deg</SUP>), X shows little systematic variation with latitude from a mean value of (1.8+/-0.3)×10<SUP>20</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> K<SUP>-1</SUP> km<SUP>-1</SUP> s. Given the large sky area and large quantity of CO data analyzed, we conclude that this is the most reliable measurement to date of the mean X value in the solar neighborhood.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of molecular clouds in galactic centres is thought to differ from that in galactic discs due to a significant influence of the external gravitational potential. We present a set of numerical simulations of molecular clouds orbiting on the 100-pc stream of the Central Molecular Zone (the central  ̃  500  pc  of the Galaxy) and characterize their morphological and kinematic evolution in response to the background potential and eccentric orbital motion. We find that the clouds are shaped by strong shear and torques, by tidal and geometric deformation, and by their passage through the orbital pericentre. Within our simulations, these mechanisms control cloud sizes, aspect ratios, position angles, filamentary structure, column densities, velocity dispersions, line-of-sight velocity gradients, spin angular momenta, and kinematic complexity. By comparing these predictions to observations of clouds on the Galactic Centre `dust ridge', we find that our simulations naturally reproduce a broad range of key observed morphological and kinematic features, which can be explained in terms of well-understood physical mechanisms. We argue that the accretion of gas clouds on to the central regions of galaxies, where the rotation curve turns over and the tidal field is fully compressive, is accompanied by transformative dynamical changes to the clouds, leading to collapse and star formation. This can generate an evolutionary progression of cloud collapse with a common starting point, which either marks the time of accretion on to the tidally compressive region or of the most recent pericentre passage. Together, these processes may naturally produce the synchronized starbursts observed in numerous (extra)galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of Galactic bulge stars from Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 observations of the Stanek window (l, b = [0.25, −2.15]) from two epochs approximately two years apart. This data set is adjacent to the provisional Wide-field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) microlensing field. Proper motions are measured for approximately 115,000 stars down to 28th mag in V band and 25th mag in I band, with accuracies of 0.5 mas yr<SUP>−1</SUP> (20 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>) at I ≈ 21. A cut on the longitudinal proper motion μ<SUB>l</SUB> allows us to separate disk and bulge populations and produce bulge-only star counts that are corrected for photometric completeness and efficiency of the proper-motion cut. The kinematic dispersions and surface density in the field are compared to the nearby SWEEPS sight line, finding a marginally larger-than-expected gradient in stellar density. The observed bulge star counts and kinematics are further compared to the Besan{\c c}on, Galaxia, and GalMod Galactic population synthesis models. We find that most of the models underpredict low-mass bulge stars by ̃33% below the main-sequence turnoff, and upwards of ̃70% at redder J and H wavebands. While considering inaccuracies in the Galactic models, we give implications for the exoplanet yield from the WFIRST microlensing mission.},

We have implemented real-time MCMC convergence tests to ensure adequate sampling of the posterior. RadVel can output a number of publication-quality plots and tables. Users may interface with RadVel through a convenient command-line interface or directly from Python. The code is object-oriented and thus naturally extensible.

Three of the most used softwares are the Python package PhotUtils, the IDL function APER, and the IRAF/PyRAF package DAOPHOT. The results produced by DAOPHOT are slightly incorrect, at approximately 0.1% too large for WFC3/IR images measured with a 3-pixel aperture (PhotUtils and APER produce the correct results). The magnitude of the DAOPHOT discrepancy is dependent on the type of source and filter used (as this impacts the PSF) due to DAOPHOT's approximation of a circle as a slightly larger irregular polygon. We present a quantification of this error for WFC3/IR data, though the analysis is applicable for any small-aperture photometry. <P />},

	Abstract = {We compared blanketed Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) models for Vega computed both with the opacity distribution function (ODF) method and the opacity-sampling (OS) method. In the ODF case we used the ATLAS9 code with the new opacity data from Kurucz (1992). Model parameters for Vega depend on the amount of reddening and on the helium abundance. For E(B-V) ranging from 0.0 to 0.01, the effective temperature T<SUB>eff</SUB> is included between 9550K and 9650K. A lower limit for the graity is log g = 3.95, obtained for T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 9550K and solar He abundance. The metallicity is (M/H) = -0.5. The parameters were fixed by comparing the observed ultraviolet, visual, and near infrared flux distribution with the computed one and by comparing observed and computed Balmer profiles. A microturbulent velocity zeta = 2 km/s was assumed on the basis of previous spectroscopic works. In the OS case, we computed a model with parameters T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 9550K, log g = 3.95, zeta = 2 km/s, but with the real abundances of Vega, as derived from spectroscopic analyses. We used the ATLAS12 code (Kurucz 1993b). The comparison of the fluxes and Balmer profiles from the ATLAS9 and ATLAS12 models computed with the same T<SUB>eff</SUB>, log g, and zeta, but with different abundances for some elements has shown that they are almost identical, small differences occuring only in the ultraviolet. Therefore ATLAS9 fluxes can be used to predict colors of Vega. The more realistic ATLAS12 models should be used as starting point for abundance analyses and for spectrum synthesis.},

Cohen. The three primary WD standards provide absolute flux calibrations for FOS, STIS and <P />NICMOS spectrophotometry from these instruments on the HST. About 32 stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) have been constructed with a primary pedigree from the STIS data, which extends from 1150{\AA}{\AA} for the hot stars to a long wavelength limit of 1 μm. NICMOS grism spectrophotometry provides an extension to 1.9 μm in the IR for 17 of the HST standards and longward to 2.5 μm for a few of the brighter stars. Included among these HST standards are Vega, the Sloan standard BD+17 4708, three bright solar analog candidates, three cool stars of type M or later, and five hot WDs. In addition, four K giants and four main sequence A-stars have NICMOS spectrophotometry from 0.8-2.5 μm. The WD fluxes are compared to their modeled SEDs and demonstrate an internal precision of 1-2%, while the A-stars agree with the Cohen IR fluxes to ̃2%. Three solar analog candidate stars differ from the solar spectrum by up to 10% in the region of heavy line blanketing from 3000-4000{\AA}{\AA} and show differences in shape of ̃5% in the IR around 1.8 μm. <P />},

	Abstract = {Stellar population synthesis techniques for predicting the observable light emitted by a stellar population have extensive applications in numerous areas of astronomy. However, accurate predictions for small populations of young stars, such as those found in individual star clusters, star-forming dwarf galaxies, and small segments of spiral galaxies, require that the population be treated stochastically. Conversely, accurate deductions of the properties of such objects also require consideration of stochasticity. Here we describe a comprehensive suite of modular, open-source software tools for tackling these related problems. These include the following: a greatly-enhanced version of the SLUG code introduced by da Silva et al., which computes spectra and photometry for stochastically or deterministically sampled stellar populations with nearly arbitrary star formation histories, clustering properties, and initial mass functions; CLOUDY_SLUG, a tool that automatically couples SLUG-computed spectra with the CLOUDY radiative transfer code in order to predict stochastic nebular emission; BAYESPHOT, a general-purpose tool for performing Bayesian inference on the physical properties of stellar systems based on unresolved photometry; and CLUSTER_SLUG and SFR_SLUG, a pair of tools that use BAYESPHOT on a library of SLUG models to compute the mass, age, and extinction of mono-age star clusters, and the star formation rate of galaxies, respectively. The latter two tools make use of an extensive library of pre-computed stellar population models, which are included in the software. The complete package is available at http://www.slugsps.com.},

	Abstract = {We present a new Milky Way microlensing simulation code, dubbed PopSyCLE (Population Synthesis for Compact object Lensing Events). PopSyCLE is the first resolved microlensing simulation to include a compact object distribution derived from numerical supernova explosion models and both astrometric and photometric microlensing effects. We demonstrate the capabilities of PopSyCLE by investigating the optimal way to find black holes (BHs) with microlensing. Candidate BHs have typically been selected from wide-field photometric microlensing surveys, such as OGLE, by selecting events with long Einstein crossing times (t<SUB>E</SUB> &gt; 120 days). These events can be selected at closest approach and monitored astrometrically in order to constrain the mass of each lens; PopSyCLE predicts a BH detection rate of ̃40% for such a program. We find that the detection rate can be enhanced to ̃85% by selecting events with both t<SUB>E</SUB> &gt; 120 days and a microlensing parallax of π<SUB>E</SUB> &lt; 0.08. Unfortunately, such a selection criterion cannot be applied during the event, as π<SUB>E</SUB> requires both pre- and post-peak photometry. However, historical microlensing events from photometric surveys can be revisited using this new selection criterion in order to statistically constrain the abundance of BHs in the Milky Way. The future Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) microlensing survey provides both precise photometry and astrometry and will yield individual masses of $  \mathcal O  (100\mbox -- 1000)$ BHs, which is at least an order of magnitude more than is possible with individual candidate follow-up with current facilities. The resulting sample of BH masses from WFIRST will begin to constrain the shape of the BH present-day mass function, BH multiplicity, and BH kick velocity distributions.},

	Abstract = {Context. Within the central 10 pc of our Galaxy lies a dense cluster of stars. This nuclear star cluster forms a distinct component of the Galaxy, and similar nuclear star clusters are found in most nearby spiral and elliptical galaxies. Studying the structure and kinematics of nuclear star clusters reveals the history of mass accretion and growth of galaxy nuclei and central massive black holes. <BR /> Aims: Because the Milky Way nuclear star cluster is at a distance of only 8 kpc, we can spatially resolve the cluster on sub-parsec scales. This makes the Milky Way nuclear star cluster a reference object for understanding the formation of all nuclear star clusters. <BR /> Methods: We have used the near-infrared long-slit spectrograph ISAAC (VLT) in a drift-scan to construct an integral-field spectroscopic map of the central ̃9.5 × 8 pc of our Galaxy, and six smaller fields out to 19 pc along the Galactic plane. We use this spectroscopic data set to extract stellar kinematics both of individual stars and from the unresolved integrated light spectrum. We present a velocity and dispersion map from the integrated light spectra and model these kinematics using kinemetry and axisymmetric Jeans models. We also measure radial velocities and CO bandhead strengths of 1375 spectra from individual stars. <BR /> Results: We find kinematic complexity in the nuclear star clusters radial velocity map including a misalignment of the kinematic position angle by 9<SUP>◦</SUP> counterclockwise relative to the Galactic plane, and indications for a rotating substructure perpendicular to the Galactic plane at a radius of 20<SUP>''</SUP> or ̃0.8 pc. We determine the mass of the nuclear star cluster within r = 4.2 pc to (1.4<SUP>+0.6</SUP><SUB>-0.7</SUB>) × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>. We also show that our kinematic data results in a significant underestimation of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. <BR /> Conclusions: The kinematic substructure and position angle misalignment may hint at distinct accretion events. This indicates that the Milky Way nuclear star cluster grew at least partly by the mergers of massive star clusters. Compared to other nuclear star clusters, the Milky Way nuclear star cluster is on the compact side of the r<SUB>eff</SUB> - M<SUB>NSC</SUB> relation. The underestimation of the SMBH mass might be caused by the kinematic misalignment and a stellar population gradient. But it is also possible that there is a bias in SMBH mass measurements obtained with integrated light, and this might affect SMBH mass determinations of other galaxies. <P />Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, Chile (289.B-5010(A)).Appendices are available in electronic form at <A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201423777/olm">http://www.aanda.org</A>Spectra and data cubes are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/570/A2">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/570/A2</A>},

	Abstract = {The Milky Way nuclear star cluster (MWNSC) is a crucial laboratory for studying the galactic nuclei of other galaxies, but its properties have not been determined unambiguously until now. Aims. We aim to study the size and spatial structure of the MWNSC. Methods. This study uses data and methods that address potential shortcomings of previous studies on the topic. We use $0.2''$ angular resolution $K_ s $ data to create a stellar density map in the central $86.4$pc x $21$pc at the Galactic center. We include data from selected adaptive-optics-assisted images obtained for the inner parsecs. In addition, we use IRAC/Spitzer mid-infrared (MIR) images. We model the Galactic bulge and the nuclear stellar disk in order to subtract them from the MWNSC. Finally, we fit a S{\'e}rsic model to the MWNSC and investigate its symmetry. Results. Our results are consistent with previous work. The MWNSC is flattened with an axis ratio of $q=0.71 \pm0.10$, an effective radius of $R_ e =(5.1 \pm1.0)$ pc, and a S{\'e}rsic index of $n=2.2 \pm0.7$. Its major axis may be tilted out of the Galactic plane by up to $-10$ degrees. The distribution of the giants brighter than the Red Clump (RC) is found to be significantly flatter than the distribution of the faint stars. We investigate the 3D structure of the central stellar cusp using our results on the MWNSC structure on large scales to constrain the deprojection of the measured stellar surface number density, obtaining a value of the 3D inner power law of $\gamma=1.38\pm0.06_ sys \pm0.01_ stat $. Conclusions. The MWNSC shares its main properties with other extragalactic NSCs found in spiral galaxies. The differences in the structure between bright giants and RC stars might be related to the existence of not completely mixed populations of different ages. This may hint at recent growth of the MWNSC through star formation or cluster accretion.},

	Abstract = {Context: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are located at the photometric and dynamical centers of the majority of galaxies. They are among the densest star clusters in the Universe. The NSC in the Milky Way is the only object of this class that can be resolved into individual stars. The massive black hole Sagittarius A* is located at the dynamical center of the Milky Way NSC. <BR />Aims: In this work we examine the proper motions of stars out to distances of 1.0 pc from Sgr A*. The aim is to examine the velocity structure of the MW NSC and acquire a reliable estimate of the stellar mass in the central parsec of the MW NSC, in addition to the well-known black hole mass. <BR />Methods: We use multi-epoch adaptive optics assisted near-infrared observations of the central parsec of the Galaxy obtained with NACO/CONICA at the ESO VLT. Stellar positions are measured via PSF fitting in the individual images and transformed into a common reference frame via suitable sets of reference stars. <BR />Results: We measured the proper motions of more than 6000 stars within ~1.0 pc of Sagittarius A*. The full data set is provided in this work. We largely exclude the known early-type stars with their peculiar dynamical properties from the dynamical analysis. The cluster is found to rotate parallel to Galactic rotation, while the velocity dispersion appears isotropic (or anisotropy may be masked by the cluster rotation). The Keplerian fall-off of the velocity dispersion due to the point mass of Sgr A* is clearly detectable only at R ⪉ 0.3 pc. Nonparametric isotropic and anisotropic Jeans models are applied to the data. They imply a best-fit black hole mass of 3.6^+0.2<SUB>-0.4</SUB> × 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>. Although this value is slightly lower than the current canonical value of 4.0 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>, this is the first time that a proper motion analysis provides a mass for Sagittarius A* that is consistent with the mass inferred from orbits of individual stars. The point mass of Sagittarius A* is not sufficient to explain the velocity data. In addition to the black hole, the models require the presence of an extended mass of 0.5-1.5 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> in the central parsec. This is the first time that the extended mass of the nuclear star cluster is unambiguously detected. The influence of the extended mass on the gravitational potential becomes notable at distances ⪆0.4 pc from Sgr A*. Constraints on the distribution of this extended mass are weak. The extended mass can be explained well by the mass of the stars that make up the cluster. <P />Appendices are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org Full Table [see full text] is only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/502/91},

	Abstract = {Stellar population synthesis (SPS) provides the link between the stellar and dust content of galaxies and their observed spectral energy distributions. In the present work, we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS (FSPS) model against a suite of data. These data include ultraviolet, optical, and near-IR photometry, surface brightness fluctuations, and integrated spectra of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), M87, M31, and the Milky Way (MW), and photometry and spectral indices of both quiescent and post-starburst galaxies at z ~ 0. Several public SPS models are intercompared, including the models of Bruzual &amp; Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05), and FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated, with the following conclusions: (1) the FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably with MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age dependence is incorrect; (2) all models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old metal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J - K and V - K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; (3) FSPS is able to fit all of the ultraviolet data because both the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) and horizontal branch evolutionary phases are handled flexibly, while the BC03 and M05 models fail in the far-UV, and both far- and near-UV, respectively; (4) all models predict ugr colors too red, D <SUB> n </SUB>4000 strengths too strong, and Hδ<SUB> A </SUB> strengths too weak compared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such galaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; and (5) FSPS and, to a lesser extent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst galaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The failure at predicting the ugr colors, D <SUB> n </SUB>4000, and Hδ<SUB> A </SUB> strengths can be explained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars, young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch (HB) stars, but not by appealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or canonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main-sequence turnoff). The different model predictions in the near-IR for intermediate age systems are due to different treatments of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stellar evolutionary phase. We emphasize that due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the metallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to suffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.},

@article{Conroy:2009le,
	Abstract = {The stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population synthesis (SPS) techniques. SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) to translate the evolution of a multimetallicity, multi-age set of stars into a prediction for the time-evolution of the integrated light from that set of stars. Each of these necessary inputs carries significant uncertainties that have until now received little systematic attention. The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new SPS model. Significant results include the following. (1) Including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z ~ 0 carry errors of ~0.3 dex at 95% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z ~ 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the ~0.6 dex level. (2) Either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally pulsating AGB phase. (3) Conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the ~0.4 mag level in the K band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time. Any possible evolution in the IMF, as suggested by several independent lines of evidence, will only exacerbate this problem. (4) Assuming a distribution of stellar metallicities within a galaxy, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can yield important differences when considering bands blueward of V, but is not a concern for redder bands. Spectroscopic information may alleviate some of these concerns, though uncertainties in the stellar spectral libraries and the importance of nonsolar abundance ratios have not yet been systematically investigated in the SPS context.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range from far-UV to far-IR make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high reliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust emission at the same time. <BR />Methods: For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale &amp; Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes were computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. <BR />Results: For up to 17 filters with effective wavelengths between 0.15 and 160 μm, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 {\AA}, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. Details of the star formation history (excepting the burst fraction) and the shape of the attenuation curve are difficult to investigate with the available broad-band UV and optical photometric data. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> towards higher total stellar masses. The dustiest galaxies in the SINGS sample are present in the same mass range. On the other hand, the far-UV attenuation of our sample galaxies does not appear to show a significant dependence on star formation activity. <BR />Conclusions: The results for our SINGS test sample demonstrate that CIGALE can be a valuable tool for studying basic properties of galaxies in the near and distant Universe if UV-to-IR data are available.},

	Abstract = {This is the first paper of a series that describes the methods and basic results of the GALICS model (Galaxies In Cosmological Simulations). GALICS is a hybrid model for hierarchical galaxy formation studies, combining the outputs of large cosmological N-body simulations with simple, semi-analytic recipes to describe the fate of the baryons within dark matter haloes. The simulations produce a detailed merging tree for the dark matter haloes, including complete knowledge of the statistical properties arising from the gravitational forces. We intend to predict the overall statistical properties of galaxies, with special emphasis on the panchromatic spectral energy distribution emitted by galaxies in the ultraviolet/optical and infrared/submillimetre wavelength ranges. <P />In this paper, we outline the physically motivated assumptions and key free parameters that go into the model, comparing and contrasting with other parallel efforts. We specifically illustrate the success of the model in comparison with several data sets, showing how it is able to predict the galaxy disc sizes, colours, luminosity functions from the ultraviolet to far infrared, the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations, and the fundamental plane in the local Universe. We also identify certain areas where the model fails, or where the assumptions needed to succeed are at odds with observations, and pay special attention to understanding the effects of the finite resolution of the simulations on the predictions made. Other papers in this series will take advantage of different data sets available in the literature to extend the study of the limitations and predictive power of GALICS, with particular emphasis put on high-redshift galaxies.},

	Abstract = {A code computing consistently the evolution of stars, gas and dust, as well as the energy they radiate, is required to derive reliably the history of galaxies by fitting synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to multiwavelength observations. The new code P{\'E}GASE.3 described in this paper extends to the far-infrared/submillimeter the ultraviolet-to-near-infrared modeling provided by previous versions of P{\'E}GASE. It first computes the properties of single stellar populations at various metallicities. It then follows the evolution of the stellar light of a galaxy and the abundances of the main metals in the interstellar medium (ISM), assuming some scenario of mass assembly and star formation. It simultaneously calculates the masses of the various grain families, the optical depth of the galaxy and the attenuation of the SED through the diffuse ISM in spiral and spheroidal galaxies, using grids of radiative transfer precomputed with Monte Carlo simulations taking scattering into account. The code determines the mean radiation field and the temperature probability distribution of stochastically heated individual grains. It then sums up their spectra to yield the overall emission by dust in the diffuse ISM. The nebular emission of the galaxy is also computed, and a simple modeling of the effects of dust on the SED of star-forming regions is implemented. The main outputs are ultraviolet-to-submillimeter SEDs of galaxies from their birth up to 20 Gyr, colors, masses of galactic components, ISM abundances of metallic elements and dust species, supernova rates. The temperatures and spectra of individual grains are also available. The paper discusses several of these outputs for a scenario representative of Milky Way-like spirals. P{\'E}GASE.3 is fully documented and its Fortran 95 source files are public. The code should be especially useful for cosmological simulations and to interpret future mid- and far-infrared data, whether obtained by JWST, LSST, Euclid or e-ELT. <P />Available at <A href="http://www.iap.fr/users/fioc/Pegase/Pegase.3/">http://www.iap.fr/users/fioc/Pegase/Pegase.3/</A> and <A href="http://www.iap.fr/pegase/">http://www.iap.fr/pegase/</A>A copy of the code is available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/623/A143">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/623/A143</A>},

	Abstract = {The effects of stochasticity on the luminosities of stellar populations are an often neglected but crucial element for understanding populations in the low-mass or the low star formation rate regime. To address this issue, we present SLUG, a new code to "Stochastically Light Up Galaxies." SLUG synthesizes stellar populations using a Monte Carlo technique that properly treats stochastic sampling including the effects of clustering, the stellar initial mass function, star formation history, stellar evolution, and cluster disruption. This code produces many useful outputs, including (1) catalogs of star clusters and their properties such as their stellar initial mass distributions and their photometric properties in a variety of filters, (2) two dimensional histograms of color-magnitude diagrams of every star in the simulation, and (3) the photometric properties of field stars and the integrated photometry of the entire simulated galaxy. After presenting the SLUG algorithm in detail, we validate the code through comparisons with STARBURST99 in the well-sampled regime, and with observed photometry of Milky Way clusters. Finally, we demonstrate SLUG's capabilities by presenting outputs in the stochastic regime. SLUG is publicly distributed through the Web site http://sites.google.com/site/runslug/.},

@article{Fioc:1997ul,
	Abstract = {PEGASE (Projet d'Etude des GAlaxies par Synthese Evolutive, in French) is a new spectrophotometric evolution model for starbursts and evolved galaxies of the Hubble sequence. Its main originality is the extension to the near-infrared (NIR) of the atlas of synthetic spectra of Rocca-Volmerange &amp; Guiderdoni (1988A&amp;AS...75...93R) with a revised stellar library including cold star parameters and stellar tracks extended to the thermally-pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) and the post-AGB (PAGB) phase. The NIR is coherently linked to the visible and the ultraviolet (UV), so that the model is continuous on an exceptionally large wavelength range from 220{\AA} up to 5μm. Moreover, a precise algorithm allows to follow very rapid evolutionary phases such as red supergiants or AGB crucial in the NIR. The nebular component is also computed in the NIR. The extinction correction is gas-dependent for spirals and ellipticals. A set of reference synthetic spectra at z=0, to which apply cosmological k- and evolution e- corrections for high-redshift galaxies, is built from fits of observational templates. Because of the lack of visible to NIR spectral templates for each Hubble type, we adopt statistical samples of colors, not fitted by previous models. A first application of this continuous model is to solve the problem of the slope of the bright galaxy counts from B=15 to 19 and of the normalization parameter φ_*_ of the Schechter luminosity function. Designed to be used currently and to take into account easily new observational and theoretical inputs, the model is built as a series of independent blocks. Any block is clearly identified and submitted to publication. Code sources, input and output data are available by anonymous ftp at ftp.iap.fr in /pub/from_users/pegase/ or at the WEB address of the authors: http://www.iap.fr/users/.},

	Abstract = {We present a new geometric distortion model for the narrow-field mode of the near-infrared camera (NIRC2) fed by the adaptive optics system on the W. M. Keck II telescope. The adaptive optics system and NIRC2 camera were realigned on 2015 April 13. Observations of the crowded globular cluster, M53, were obtained before and after the realignment to characterize the geometric field distortion. The distorted NIRC2 positions of M53 stars were compared with precise astrometry of this cluster from Hubble Space Telescope observations. The resulting distortion map constructed just before the realignment is consistent with the previous solution derived using data from 2007 to 2009, indicating that the distortion has been stable to ̃0.5 mas. The distortion map changed significantly after a realignment of 4.5 mas (75%) rms, and the new distortion model for post-realignment observations have a total accuracy of ̃1.1 mas.},

	Abstract = {Westerlund 1 (Wd1) is potentially the largest star cluster in the Galaxy. That designation critically depends upon the distance to the cluster, yet the cluster is highly obscured, making luminosity-based distance estimates difficult. Using Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) parallaxes and Bayesian inference, we infer a parallax of 0.35^ +0.07 _ -0.06  mas corresponding to a distance of 2.6^ +0.6 _ -0.4  kpc. To leverage the combined statistics of all stars in the direction of Wd1, we derive the Bayesian model for a cluster of stars hidden among Galactic field stars; this model includes the parallax zero-point. Previous estimates for the distance to Wd1 ranged from 1.0 to 5.5 kpc, although values around 5 kpc have usually been adopted. The Gaia DR2 parallaxes reduce the uncertainty from a factor of 3 to 18 per cent and rules out the most often quoted value of 5 kpc with 99 per cent confidence. This new distance allows for more accurate mass and age determinations for the stars in Wd1. For example, the previously inferred initial mass at the main-sequence turn-off was around 40 M<SUB>☉</SUB>; the new Gaia DR2 distance shifts this down to about 22 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. This has important implications for our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution, including the initial mass of the magnetar and the LBV in Wd1. Similarly, the new distance suggests that the total cluster mass is about four times lower than previously calculated.},

	Abstract = {We report measurements with the Very Long Baseline Array of the proper motion of Sgr A* relative to two extragalactic radio sources spanning 18 years. The apparent motion of Sgr A* is -6.411 +/- 0.008 mas/yr along the Galactic plane and -0.219 +/- 0.007 mas/yr toward the North Galactic Pole. This apparent motion can almost entirely be attributed to the effects of the Sun's orbit about the Galactic center. Removing these effects yields residuals of -0.58 +/- 2.23 km/s in the direction of Galactic rotation and -0.85 +/- 0.75 km/s toward the North Galactic Pole. A maximum-likelihood analysis of the motion, both in the Galactic plane and perpendicular to it, expected for a massive object within the Galactic center stellar cluster indicates that the radiative source, Sgr A*, contains more than about 25% of the gravitational mass of 4 x 10^6 Msun deduced from stellar orbits. The intrinsic size of Sgr A* is comparable to its Schwarzschild radius, and the implied mass density of >4 x 10^23 Msun/pc^-3 very close to that expected for a black hole, providing overwhelming evidence that it is indeed a super-massive black hole. Finally, the existence of "intermediate-mass" black holes more massive than 3 x 10^4 Msun between approximately 0.003 and 0.1 pc from Sgr A*are excluded.},

	Abstract = {Our Hubble Space Telescope/Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (HST/NICMOS) Paschen α survey of the Galactic Centre, first introduced by Wang et al., provides a uniform, panoramic, high-resolution map of stars and an ionized diffuse gas in the central 416 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> of the Galaxy. This survey was carried out with 144 HST orbits using two narrow-band filters at 1.87 and 1.90 μm in NICMOS Camera 3. In this paper, we describe in detail the data reduction and mosaicking procedures followed, including background level matching and astrometric corrections. We have detected ̃570 000 near-infrared (near-IR) sources using the `starfinder' software and are able to quantify photometric uncertainties of the detections. The source detection limit varies across the survey field, but the typical 50 per cent completion limit is ̃17th magnitude (Vega system) in the 1.90 μm band. A comparison with the expected stellar magnitude distribution shows that these sources are primarily main-sequence massive stars (≳7 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) and evolved lower mass stars at the distance of the Galactic Centre. In particular, the observed source magnitude distribution exhibits a prominent peak, which could represent the red clump (RC) stars within the Galactic Centre. The observed magnitude and colour of these RC stars support a steep extinction curve in the near-IR towards the Galactic Centre. The flux ratios of our detected sources in the two bands also allow for an adaptive and statistical estimate of extinction across the field. With the subtraction of the extinction-corrected continuum, we construct a net Paschen α emission map and identify a set of Paschen α emitting sources, which should mostly be evolved massive stars with strong stellar winds. The majority of the identified Paschen α point sources are located within the three known massive Galactic Centre stellar clusters. However, a significant fraction of our Paschen α emitting sources are located outside the clusters and may represent a new class of `field' massive stars, many of which may have formed in isolation and/or in small groups. The maps and source catalogues presented here are available electronically.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the evolution of a massive galactic nucleus hosting a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with mass M<SUB>SMBH</SUB> = 10<SUP>8</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB> surrounded by a population of 42 heavy star clusters (globular clusters, GCs). Using direct N-body modelling, we show here that the assembly of a nuclear star cluster (NSC) through GC orbital decay and merger is efficiently inhibited by the tidal forces exerted from the SMBH. The GC mass-loss induced by tidal forces causes a significant modification of their mass function, leading to a population of low-mass (&lt;10<SUP>4</SUP>) clusters. None the less, the GC debris accumulated around the SMBH give rise to well-defined kinematical and morphological properties, leading to the formation of a disc-like structure. Interestingly, the disc is similar to the one observed in the M31 galaxy nucleus, which has properties similar to our numerical model. The simulation produced a huge amount of data, which we used to investigate whether the GC debris deposited around the SMBH can enhance the rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) in our galaxy inner density distribution. Our results suggest that the GC disruption leads to a TDE rate of ̃2 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, about an order of magnitude larger than observed in galactic nuclei with similar density profiles and central SMBH. Our results suggest that the GC disruption shapes the SMBH neighbourhoods, leading to a TDE rate of ̃2 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, a value slightly larger than what expected in previous theoretical modelling of galaxies with similar density profiles and central SMBHs. The simulation presented here is the first of its kind, representing a massive galactic nucleus and its star cluster population on scales ̃100 pc.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we explore the interplay between intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and their nursing globular clusters (GCs), taking advantage of over 2000 Monte Carlo GC models. We find that the average density of IMBHs sphere of influence can be uniquely connected to the host GCs luminosity and half-light radius via a fundamental plane. We propose a statistical approach to systematically identify potential Galactic GCs harbouring either an IMBH or a massive subsystem comprised of stellar BHs. Our models show that the IMBH is often bound to a stellar companion or a stellar BH, which can lead to tidal disruption events or to low-frequency gravitational waves. We show that GCs orbiting close to the Galactic Centre have a larger probability to witness IMBH formation during their early evolution. These low-orbit GCs can deliver several IMBHs into the galaxy innermost regions, with potential impact on both electromagnetic and GW emission. We discuss potential connections between IMBHs and SMBHs inhabiting galactic nuclei, exploring the possibility that in some cases they share similar formation pathways. <P />},

	Abstract = {The nuclear bulge is a region with a radius of about 200 parsecs around the centre of the Milky Way. It contains stars with ages ranging from a few million years to over a billion years, yet its star-formation history and the triggering process for star formation remain to be resolved. Recently, episodic star formation, powered by changes in the gas content, has been suggested. Classical Cepheid variable stars have pulsation periods that decrease with increasing age, so it is possible to probe the star-formation history on the basis of the distribution of their periods. Here we report the presence of three classical Cepheids in the nuclear bulge with pulsation periods of approximately 20days, within 40 parsecs (projected distance) of the central black hole. No Cepheids with longer or shorter periods were found. We infer that there was a period about 25 million years ago, and possibly lasting until recently, in which star formation increased relative to the period of 30-70 million years ago.},

	Abstract = {The electromagnetic counterpart to the Galactic center supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, has been observed in the near-infrared for over 20 yr and is known to be highly variable. We report new Keck Telescope observations showing that Sgr A* reached much brighter flux levels in 2019 than ever measured at near-infrared wavelengths. In the K′ band, Sgr A* reached flux levels of ̃6 mJy, twice the level of the previously observed peak flux from &gt;13,000 measurements over 130 nights with the Very Large Telescope and Keck Telescopes. We also observe a factor of 75 change in flux over a 2 hr time span with no obvious color changes between 1.6 and 2.1 μm. The distribution of flux variations observed this year is also significantly different than the historical distribution. Using the most comprehensive statistical model published, the probability of a single night exhibiting peak flux levels observed this year, given historical Keck observations, is less than 0.3%. The probability of observing flux levels that are similar to all four nights of data in 2019 is less than 0.05%. This increase in brightness and variability may indicate a period of heightened activity from Sgr A* or a change in its accretion state. It may also indicate that the current model is not sufficient to model Sgr A* at high flux levels and should be updated. Potential physical origins of Sgr A*'s unprecedented brightness may be from changes in the accretion flow as a result of the star S0-2's closest passage to the black hole in 2018, or from a delayed reaction to the approach of the dusty object G2 in 2014. Additional multi-wavelength observations will be necessary to both monitor Sgr A* for potential state changes and to constrain the physical processes responsible for its current variability.},

@article{Chen:2019dp,
	Abstract = {We report new infrared (IR) measurements of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, Sgr A*, over a decade that was previously inaccessible at these wavelengths. This enables a variability study that addresses variability timescales that are 10 times longer than earlier published studies. Sgr A* was initially detected in the near-infrared (NIR) with adaptive optics observations in 2002. While earlier data exists in form of speckle imaging (1995-2005), Sgr A* was not detected in the initial analysis. Here, we improved our speckle holography analysis techniques. This has improved the sensitivity of the resulting speckle images by up to a factor of three. Sgr A* is now detectable in the majority of epochs covering 7 yr. The brightness of Sgr A* in the speckle data has an average observed K magnitude of 16.0, which corresponds to a dereddened flux density of 3.4 mJy. Furthermore, the flat power spectral density of Sgr A* between ̃80 days and 7 yr shows its uncorrelation in time beyond the proposed single power-law break of ̃245 minutes. We report that the brightness and its variability is consistent over 22 yr. This analysis is based on simulations using the Witzel et al. model to characterize IR variability from 2006 to 2016. Finally, we note that the 2001 periapse of the extended, dusty object G1 had no apparent effect on the NIR emission from accretion flow onto Sgr A*. The result is consistent with G1 being a self-gravitating object rather than a disrupting gas cloud.},

	Abstract = {Determining the properties of old stellar populations (those with age &gt;1 Gyr) has long involved the comparison of their integrated light, either in the form of photometry or spectroscopic indexes, with empirical or synthetic templates. Here we re-evaluate the properties of old stellar populations using a new set of stellar population synthesis models, designed to incorporate the effects of binary stellar evolution pathways as a function of stellar mass and age. We find that single-aged stellar population models incorporating binary stars, as well as new stellar evolution and atmosphere models, can reproduce the colours and spectral indices observed in both globular clusters and quiescent galaxies. The best-fitting model populations are often younger than those derived from older spectral synthesis models and may also lie at slightly higher metallicities. <P />},

	Abstract = {We describe a novel method for determining the demographics of a population of star clusters, for example distributions of cluster mass and age, from unresolved photometry. This method has a number of desirable properties: it fully exploits all the information available in a data set without any binning, correctly accounts for both measurement error and sample incompleteness, naturally handles heterogenous data (e.g. fields that have been imaged with different sets of filters or to different depths), marginalizes over uncertain extinctions, and returns the full posterior distributions of the parameters describing star cluster demographics. We demonstrate the method using mock star cluster catalogues and show that our method is robust and accurate, and that it can recover the demographics of star cluster populations significantly better than traditional fitting methods. For realistic sample sizes, our method is sufficiently powerful that its accuracy is ultimately limited by the accuracy of the underlying physical models for stellar evolution and interstellar dust, rather than by statistical uncertainties. Our method is implemented as part of the Stochastically Lighting Up Galaxies (SLUG) stellar populations code, and is freely available.},

There is clear evidence for the presence of stars down to 1 \Mscr<SUB>solar</SUB> or less. No cutoff or turnover in the initial mass function is evident. Applying theoretical models of the pre-main-sequence evolution of intermediate-mass stars to the observed color-color diagram, the color-magnitude diagram, and the luminosity function, we constrain both the age distribution and the initial mass function. Within the systematic errors, this initial mass function follows a Salpeter power law with index Γ &lt;= -0.73 down to the observational limit of less than 1 \Mscr<SUB>solar</SUB>. The stars with less than 4 \Mscr<SUB>solar</SUB> appear to be younger than 10<SUP>6</SUP> yr, in contrast to previous age determinations of the high-mass content of HD 97950.

	Abstract = {Proper motion studies of stars in the centre of the Milky Way have been typically limited to the Arches and Quintuplet clusters and to the central parsec. Here, we present the first results of a large-scale proper motion study of stars within several tens of parsecs of Sagittarius A* based on our $0.2''$ angular resolution GALACTICNUCLEUS survey (epoch 2015) combined with NICMOS/HST data from the Paschen-$\alpha$ survey (epoch 2008). This study will be the first extensive proper motion study of the central $\sim 36' \times 16'$ of the Galaxy, which is not covered adequately by any of the existing astronomical surveys such as Gaia because of its extreme interstellar extinction ($A_{V} \gtrsim 30$ mag). Proper motions can help us to disentangle the different stellar populations along the line-of-sight and interpret their properties in combination with multi-wavelength photometry from GALACTICNUCLEUS and other sources. It also allows us to infer the dynamics and interrelationship between the different stellar components of the Galactic Centre (GC). In particular, we use proper motions to detect co-moving groups of stars which can trace low mass or partially dissolved young clusters in the GC that can hardly be discovered by any other means. Our pilot study in this work is on a field in the nuclear bulge associated by HII regions that show the presence of young stars. We detect the first group of co-moving stars coincident with an HII region. Using colour-magnitude diagrams, we infer that the co-moving stars are consistent with being the post-main sequence stars with ages of few Myrs. Simulations show that this group of stars is a real group that can indicate the existence of a dissolving or low to intermediate mass young cluster. A census of these undiscovered clusters will ultimately help us to constrain star formation at the GC in the past few ten Myrs.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of 11 bipolar outflows within a projected distance of 1 pc from Sgr A* based on deep ALMA observations of 13CO, H30alpha, and SiO (5-4) lines with subarcsecond and ˜1.3 km s-1 resolutions. These unambiguous signatures of young protostars manifest as approaching and receding lobes of dense gas swept up by the jets created during the formation and early evolution of stars. The lobe masses and momentum transfer rates are consistent with young protostellar outflows found throughout the disk of the Galaxy. The mean dynamical age of the outflow population is estimated to be {6.5}-3.6+8.1× {10}3 years. The rate of star formation is ˜5 × 10-4 {M}&sun;  yr-1 assuming a mean stellar mass of ˜0.3 {M}&sun; . This discovery provides evidence that star formation is taking place within clouds surprisingly close to Sgr A*, perhaps due to events that compress the host cloud, creating condensations with sufficient self-gravity to resist tidal disruption by Sgr A*. Low-mass star formation over the past few billion years at this level would contribute significantly to the stellar mass budget in the central few parsecs of the Galaxy. The presence of many dense clumps of molecular material within 1 pc of Sgr A* suggests that star formation could take place in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of external galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Due to the extreme extinction towards the Galactic centre ($A_{V} \sim 30$ mag), its stellar population is mainly studied in the near-infrared (NIR) regime. Therefore, a proper analysis of the NIR extinction curve is necessary to fully characterise the stellar structure and population of the inner part of the galaxy. We studied the dependence of the extinction index ($\alpha_\lambda$) in the NIR on the line of sight, wavelength, and extinction. We used the GALACTICNUCLEUS imaging survey, a high angular resolution catalogue ($0.2''$) for the inner part of the Galaxy in $JHK_s$, and studied the spatial variation in the extinction index. We also applied two independent methods based on red clump stars to compute the extinction index between different bands and its variation with wavelength. We did not detect any significant line-of-sight or extinction variation in $\alpha$ within the studied region in the nuclear stellar disc. The extinction index between $JH$ and $HK_s$ differs by $0.19 \pm 0.05$. We obtained mean values for the extinction indices $\alpha_{JH} = 2.43\pm0.03$ and $\alpha_{HK_s} = 2.23\pm0.03$. The dependence of the extinction index on the wavelength could explain the differences obtained for $\alpha_\lambda$ in the literature since it was assumed constant for the NIR regime.},

	Abstract = {The high extinction and extreme source crowding of the central regions of the Milky Way are serious obstacles to the study of the structure and stellar population of the Galactic centre (GC). Existing surveys that cover the GC region (2MASS, UKIDSS, VVV, SIRIUS) do not have the necessary high angular resolution. Therefore, a high-angular-resolution survey in the near infrared is crucial to improve the state of the art. Here, we present the GALACTICNUCLEUS catalogue, a near infrared $JHK_s$ high-angular-resolution ($0.2''$) survey of the nuclear bulge of the Milky Way. We explain in detail the data reduction, data analysis, calibration, and uncertainty estimation of the GALACTICNUCLEUS survey. We assess the data quality comparing our results with previous surveys. We obtained accurate $JHK_s$ photometry for $\sim 3.3\times10^6$ stars in the GC detecting around 20 \% in $J$, 65 \% in $H,$ and 90 \% in $K_s$. The survey covers a total area of $\sim0.3$ square degrees, which corresponds to $\sim 6,000$ pc$^2$. The GALACTICNUCLEUS survey reaches 5\,$\sigma$ detections for $J \sim 22$ mag, $H \sim 21$ mag, and $K_s \sim 21$ mag. The uncertainties are below 0.05 mag at $J \sim 21$ mag, $H \sim 19$ mag, and $K_s \sim 18$ mag. The zero point systematic uncertainty is $\lesssim0.04$ mag in all three bands. We present colour-magnitude diagrams for the different regions covered by the survey.},

	Abstract = {We present limits on the ejection of solar-metallicity ("metal-rich") old-population hypervelocity stars (HVS) from a sample of over 290,000 stars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We derive the speed at the solar circle from the measured positions and radial velocities (RVs) by assuming a radial orbit and adopting a simple isothermal model of the Galactic halo, which enables us to identify candidate bound and unbound ejectees. We examine the kinematics and metallicity distribution of this sample and find no metal-rich ejectees, from which our limits are derived. However, while tuned for metal-rich stars, our experiment is also sensitive to metal-poor ejectees. We find four candidate bound metal-poor F-stars from this sample, all with negative Galactocentric RV (i.e., returning toward the Galactic center (GC)). We additionally find two candidate metal-poor unbound stars (one F and one G). However, existing proper-motion measurements of these two stars make them unlikely to be emerging from the GC. The metal-rich nondetection places a limit on the rate of ejection of old-population stars from the GC of <35 Myr-1. Comparing to the rate for more massive B-star ejectees of ~0.6 Myr-1, our limit on the rate of ejection of old-population HVS shows that the mass function at the GC is not bottom-heavy and is consistent with being normal to top-heavy. Future targeted surveys of old-population HVS could determine if it is indeed top-heavy.},

	Abstract = {MACHOs have been discovered by their relativistic amplification of light from distant stars as they crossed very close to the line-of-sight. The very few events were detected from more than a milliard photometric measurements of millions of stars in the LMC. - A mathematical theory of analysis of astrometric and photometric measurements of microlensing events is presented. It is shown that three photometric measurements and three one-dimensional astrometric measurements during an event are, in principle, sufficient to determine the - precisely - six observable physical parameters of the MACHO, including the proper motion and distance of the dark body, provided the position, motion and distance of the undeflected star has been determined from observations outside the event. The practical possibility of such observations is discussed by comparison with the proposed ROEMER satellite, an instrument concept with the potential for obtaining the many milliards of photometric and astrometric observations of the required quality. At least 300 photometric amplifications of light from stars brighter than V=16.5 mag could de detected during a ROEMER mission, but the prospects for significant astrometric observations are meagre.},

	Abstract = {Context. High-precision astrometric and radial-velocity observations require accurate modelling of stellar motions in order to extrapolate measurements over long time intervals, and to detect deviations from uniform motion caused, for example, by unseen companions.  Aims: We aim to explore the simplest possible kinematic model of stellar motions, namely that of uniform rectilinear motion relative to the solar system barycentre, in terms of observable quantities including error propagation.  Methods: The apparent path equation for uniform rectilinear motion is solved analytically in a classical (special-relativistic) framework, leading to rigorous expressions that relate the (apparent) astrometric parameters and radial velocity to the (true) kinematic parameters of the star in the barycentric reference system.  Results: We present rigorous and explicit formulae for the transformation of stellar positions, parallaxes, proper motions, and radial velocities from one epoch to another, assuming uniform rectilinear motion and taking light-time effects into account. The Jacobian matrix of the transformation is also given, allowing accurate and reversible propagation of errors over arbitrary time intervals. The light-time effects are generally very small, but exceed 0.1 mas or 0.1 m s-1 over 100 yr for at least 33 stars in the Hipparcos catalogue. For high-velocity stars within a few tens of pc from the Sun, light-time effects are generally more important than the effects of the curvature of their orbits in the Galactic potential.

	Abstract = {The central half kiloparsec region of our Galaxy harbors a variety of phenomena unique to the central environment. This review discusses the observed structure and activity of the interstellar medium in this region in terms of its inevitable inflow toward the center of the Galactic gravitational potential well. A number of dissipative processes lead to a strong concentration of gas into a "Central Molecular Zone" of about 200-pc radius, in which the molecular medium is characterized by large densities, large velocity dispersions, high temperatures, and apparently strong magnetic fields. The physical state of the gas and the resultant star formation processes occurring in this environment are therefore quite unlike those occurring in the large-scale disk. Gas not consumed by star formation either enters a hot X ray-emitting halo and is lost as a thermally driven galactic wind or continues moving inward, probably discontinuously, through the domain of the few parsec-sized circumnuclear disks and eventually into the central parsec. There, the central radio source SgrA* currently accepts only a tiny fraction of the inflowing material, likely as a result of a limit cycle wherein the continual inflow of matter provokes star formation, which in turn can temporarily halt the inflow via mass-outflow winds.},

	Abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.  Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results.  Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products.  Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.  Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

@article{Anderson:2010rz,
	Abstract = {We use an empirical approach to characterize the effect of charge-transfer efficiency (CTE) losses in images taken with the Wide-Field Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The study is based on profiles of warm pixels in 168 dark exposures taken between 2009 September and October. The dark exposures allow us to explore charge traps that affect electrons when the background is extremely low. We develop a model for the readout process that reproduces the observed trails out to 70 pixels. We then invert the model to convert the observed pixel values in an image into an estimate of the original pixel values. We find that when we apply this image-restoration process to science images with a variety of stars on a variety of background levels, it restores flux, position, and shape. This means that the observed trails contain essentially all of the flux lost to inefficient CTE. The Space Telescope Science Institute is currently evaluating this algorithm with the aim of optimizing it and eventually providing enhanced data products. The empirical procedure presented here should also work for other epochs (e.g., pre-SM4), though the parameters may have to be recomputed for the time when ACS was operated at a higher temperature than the current -81$\,^{\circ}$C. Finally, this empirical approach may also hold promise for other instruments, such as WFPC2, STIS, the ACS's HRC, and even WFC3/UVIS.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We present a high-precision measurement of the parallax for the 12-day Cepheid SS Canis Majoris, obtained via spatial scanning with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Spatial scanning enables astrometric measurements with a precision of 20-40 muas, an order of magnitude better than pointed observations. SS CMa is the second Cepheid targeted for parallax measurement with HST and is the first of a sample of 18 long-period (≳10 days) Cepheids selected in order to improve the calibration of their period-luminosity relation and eventually permit a determination of the Hubble constant H 0 to better than 2%. The parallax of SS CMa is found to be 348 $\pm$ 38 muas, corresponding to a distance of 2.9 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc. We also present a refinement of the static geometric distortion of WFC3 obtained using spatial scanning observations of calibration fields, with a typical magnitude ≲0.01 pixels on scales of 100 pixels.},

	Abstract = {We present new measurements of the parallax of seven long-period (>=10 days) Milky Way (MW) Cepheid variables (SS CMa, XY Car, VY Car, VX Per, WZ Sgr, X Pup, and S Vul) using one-dimensional astrometric measurements from spatial scanning of Wide-Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The observations were obtained at ˜6 month intervals over 4 years. The distances are 1.7-3.6 kpc, with a mean precision of 45 muas (signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) ≈ 10) and a best precision of 29 muas (S/N = 14). The accuracy of the parallaxes is demonstrated through independent analyses of >100 reference stars. This raises to 10 the number of long-period Cepheids with significant parallax measurements, 8 obtained from this program. We also present high-precision mean F555W, F814W, and F160W magnitudes of these Cepheids, allowing a direct, zeropoint-independent comparison to >1800 extragalactic Cepheids in the hosts of 19 SNe Ia. This sample addresses two outstanding systematic uncertainties affecting prior comparisons of MW and extragalactic Cepheids used to calibrate the Hubble constant (H 0): their dissimilarity of periods and photometric systems. Comparing the new parallaxes to their predicted values derived from reversing the distance ladder gives a ratio (or independent scale for H 0) of 1.037 $\pm$ 0.036, consistent with no change and inconsistent at the 3.5sigma level with a ratio of 0.91 needed to match the value predicted by Planck cosmic microwave background data in concert with LambdaCDM. Using these data instead to augment the Riess et al. measurement of H 0 improves the precision to 2.3%, yielding 73.48 $\pm$ 1.66 km s-1 Mpc-1, and the tension with Planck + LambdaCDM increases to 3.7sigma. The future combination of Gaia parallaxes and HST spatial scanning photometry of 50 MW Cepheids can support a <1% calibration of H 0.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We describe the photometric content of the second data release of the Gaia project (Gaia DR2) and its validation along with the quality of the data.  Methods: The validation was mainly carried out using an internal analysis of the photometry. External comparisons were also made, but were limited by the precision and systematics that may be present in the external catalogues used.  Results: In addition to the photometric quality assessment, we present the best estimates of the three photometric passbands. Various colour-colour transformations are also derived to enable the users to convert between the Gaia and commonly used passbands.  Conclusions: The internal analysis of the data shows that the photometric calibrations can reach a precision as low as 2 mmag on individual CCD measurements. Other tests show that systematic effects are present in the data at the 10 mmag level.},

	Abstract = {We describe the first public data release of the Dark Energy Survey, DES DR1, consisting of reduced single-epoch images, co-added images, co-added source catalogs, and associated products and services assembled over the first 3 yr of DES science operations. DES DR1 is based on optical/near-infrared imaging from 345 distinct nights (2013 August to 2016 February) by the Dark Energy Camera mounted on the 4 m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. We release data from the DES wide-area survey covering ˜5000 deg2 of the southern Galactic cap in five broad photometric bands, grizY. DES DR1 has a median delivered point-spread function of g=1.12, r = 0.96, i = 0.88, z = 0.84, and Y = 0."90 FWHM, a photometric precision of <1% in all bands, and an astrometric precision of 151  {mas}. The median co-added catalog depth for a 1."95 diameter aperture at signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 10 is g = 24.33, r = 24.08, i = 23.44, z = 22.69, and Y = 21.44  {mag} . DES DR1 includes nearly 400 million distinct astronomical objects detected in ˜10,000 co-add tiles of size 0.534 deg2 produced from ˜39,000 individual exposures. Benchmark galaxy and stellar samples contain ˜310 million and ˜80 million objects, respectively, following a basic object quality selection. These data are accessible through a range of interfaces, including query web clients, image cutout servers, jupyter notebooks, and an interactive co-add image visualization tool. DES DR1 constitutes the largest photometric data set to date at the achieved depth and photometric precision.},

@article{Koposov:2019hm,
	Abstract = {We present the serendipitous discovery of the fastest Main Sequence hyper-velocity star (HVS) by the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($S^5$). The star S5-HVS1 is a $\sim 2.3$ M$_\odot$ A-type star located at a distance of $\sim 9$ kpc from the Sun and has a heliocentric radial velocity of $1017\pm 2.7$ km/s without any signature of velocity variability. The current 3-D velocity of the star in the Galactic frame is $1755\pm50$ km/s. When integrated backwards in time, the orbit of the star points unambiguously to the Galactic Centre, implying that S5-HVS1 was kicked away from Sgr A* with a velocity of $\sim 1800$ km/s and travelled for $4.8$ Myr to the current location. This is so far the only HVS confidently associated with the Galactic Centre. S5-HVS1 is also the first hyper-velocity star to provide constraints on the geometry and kinematics of the Galaxy, such as the Solar motion $V_{y,\odot}= 246.1\pm 5.3$ km/s or position $R_0=8.12\pm 0.23$ kpc. The ejection trajectory and transit time of S5-HVS1 coincide with the orbital plane and age of the annular disk of young stars at the Galactic centre, and thus may be linked to its formation. With the S5-HVS1 ejection velocity being almost twice the velocity of other hyper-velocity stars previously associated with the Galactic Centre, we question whether they have been generated by the same mechanism or whether the ejection velocity distribution has been constant over time.},

@article{Do:2019tn,
	Abstract = {The electromagnetic counterpart to the Galactic center supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, has been observed in the near-infrared for over 20 years and is known to be highly variable. We report new Keck Telescope observations showing that Sgr A* reached much brighter flux levels in 2019 than ever measured at near-infrared wavelengths. In the K$^\prime$ band, Sgr A* reached flux levels of $\sim6$ mJy, twice the level of the previously observed peak flux from $>13,000$ measurements over 130 nights with the VLT and Keck Telescopes. We also observe a factor of 75 change in flux over a 2-hour time span with no obvious color changes between 1.6 $\mu$m and 2.1 $\mu$m. The distribution of flux variations observed this year is also significantly different than the historical distribution. Using the most comprehensive statistical model published, the probability of a single night exhibiting peak flux levels observed this year, given historical Keck observations, is less than $0.3\%$. The probability to observe the flux levels similar to all 4 nights of data in 2019 is less than $0.05\%$. This increase in brightness and variability may indicate a period of heightened activity from Sgr A* or a change in its accretion state. It may also indicate that the current model is not sufficient to model Sgr A* at high flux levels and should be updated. Potential physical origins of Sgr A*'s unprecedented brightness may be from changes in the accretion-flow as a result of the star S0-2's closest passage to the black hole in 2018 or from a delayed reaction to the approach of the dusty object G2 in 2014. Additional multi-wavelength observations will be necessary to both monitor Sgr A* for potential state changes and to constrain the physical processes responsible for its current variability.},

	Abstract = {Since the early 1970s, stellar population modelling has been one of the basic tools for understanding the physics of unresolved systems from observation of their integrated light. Models allow us to relate the integrated spectra (or colours) of a system with the evolutionary status of the stars of which it is composed and hence to infer how the system has evolved from its formation to its present stage. On average, observational data follow model predictions, but with some scatter, so that systems with the same physical parameters (age, metallicity, total mass) produce a variety of integrated spectra. The fewer the stars in a system, the larger is the scatter. Such scatter is sometimes much larger than the observational errors, reflecting its physical nature. This situation has led to the development in recent years (especially since 2010) of Monte Carlo models of stellar populations. Some authors have proposed that such models are more realistic than state-of-the-art standard synthesis codes that produce the mean of the distribution of Monte Carlo models.},

@article{Marigo:2008pf,
	Abstract = {We present a large set of theoretical isochrones, whose distinctive features mostly reside on the greatly-improved treatment of the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. Essentially, we have coupled the TP-AGB tracks described in Paper I, at their stages of pre-flash quiescent H-shell burning, with the evolutionary tracks for the previous evolutionary phases from Girardi et al. (2000, A&AS, 141, 371). Theoretical isochrones for any intermediate value of age and metallicity are then derived by interpolation in the grids. We take care that the isochrones keep, to a good level of detail, the several peculiarities present in these TP-AGB tracks - e.g., the cool tails of C-type stars owing to the use of proper molecular opacities as convective dredge-up occurs along the TP-AGB; the bell-shaped sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram for stars with hot-bottom burning; the changes of pulsation mode between fundamental and first overtone; the sudden changes of mean mass-loss rates as the surface chemistry changes from M- to C-type; etc. Theoretical isochrones are then converted to about 20 different photometric systems - including traditional ground-based systems, and those of recent major wide-field surveys such as SDSS, OGLE, DENIS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, etc., - by means of synthetic photometry applied to an updated library of stellar spectra, suitably extended to include C-type stars. Finally, we correct the predicted photometry for the effect of circumstellar dust during the mass-losing stages of the AGB evolution, which allows us to improve the results for the optical-to-infrared systems, and to simulate mid- and far-IR systems such as those of Spitzer and AKARI. We illustrate the most striking properties of these isochrones by means of basic comparisons with observational data for the Milky Way disc and the Magellanic Clouds. Access to the data is provided both via a web repository of static tables (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/dustyAGB07 and CDS), and via an interactive web interface (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cmd), which provides tables for any intermediate value of age and metallicity, for several photometric systems, and for different choices of dust properties.},

	Abstract = {This is a summary of the 2013 release of the plasma simulation code CLOUDY. CLOUDY models the ionization, chemical, and thermal state of material that may be exposed to an external radiation field or other source of heating, and predicts observables such as emission and absorption spectra. It works in terms of elementary processes, so is not limited to any particular temperature or density regime. This paper summarizes advances made since the last major review in 1998. Much of the recent development has emphasized dusty molecular environments, improvements to the ionization/chemistry solvers, and how atomic and molecular data are used. We present two types of simulations to demonstrate the capability of the code. We consider a molecular cloud irradiated by an X-ray source such as an active nucleus and show how treating EUV recombination lines and the full SED affects the observed spectrum. A second example illustrates the very wide range of particle and radiation density that can be considered.},

@article{Kremer:2019ph,
	Abstract = {As self-gravitating systems, dense star clusters exhibit a natural diffusion of energy from their innermost to outermost regions, which leads to a slow and steady contraction of the core until it ultimately collapses under gravity. However, in spite of the natural tendency toward so-called "core collapse," the globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way exhibit a well-observed bimodal distribution in core radii separating the core-collapsed and non-core-collapsed clusters. This suggests an internal energy source is at work, delaying the onset of core collapse in many clusters. Primordial binary stars have been thought for a long time to provide this energy source, but recent analyses have cast doubt upon the corresponding "binary-burning" mechanism as a viable explanation. Over the past decade, a large amount of both observational and theoretical work has suggested that many stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are retained in typical clusters today and that they play a dynamically-significant role in these clusters throughout their entire lifetimes. Here we review our latest understanding of the formation and evolution of BH populations in GCs and demonstrate that, through their dynamical interaction with their host cluster, BHs can naturally explain the distinction between core-collapsed and non-core-collapsed clusters through a process we call "black hole burning."},

	Abstract = {We present an extended grid of state-of-the art stellar models for low-mass stars including updated physics (nuclear reaction rates, surface boundary condition, mass-loss rate, angular momentum transport, torque and rotation-induced mixing prescriptions). We aim at evaluating the impact of wind braking, realistic atmospheric treatment, rotation and rotation-induced mixing on the structural and rotational evolution from the pre-main sequence to the turn-off. Using the STAREVOL code, we provide an updated PMS grid. We compute stellar models for 7 different metallicities, from [Fe/H] = -1 dex to [Fe/H] = +0.3 dex with a solar composition corresponding to $Z=0.0134$. The initial stellar mass ranges from 0.2 to 1.5\Ms with extra grid refinement around one solar mass. We also provide rotating models for three different initial rotation rates (slow, median and fast) with prescriptions for the wind braking and disc-coupling timescale calibrated on observed properties of young open clusters. The rotational mixing includes an up-to-date description of the turbulence anisotropy in stably stratified regions. The overall behaviour of our models at solar metallicity -- and its constitutive physics -- is validated through a detailed comparison with a variety of distributed evolutionary tracks. The main differences arise from the choice of surface boundary conditions and initial solar composition. The models including rotation with our prescription for angular momentum extraction and self-consistent formalism for angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the rotation period distribution observed in young open clusters over a broad mass-range. These models are publicly available and may be used to analyse data coming from present and forthcoming asteroseismic and spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, TESS and PLATO.},

	Abstract = {Numerical simulations have shown that black holes (BHs) can strongly influence the evolution and present-day observational properties of globular clusters (GCs). Using a Monte Carlo code, we construct GC models that match the Milky Way cluster NGC 3201, the first cluster in which a stellar-mass BH was identified through radial velocity measurements. We predict that NGC 3201 contains ≳200 stellar-mass BHs. Furthermore, we explore the dynamical formation of main-sequence-BH binaries and demonstrate that systems similar to the observed BH binary in NGC 3201 are produced naturally. Additionally, our models predict the existence of bright blue straggler-BH binaries that are unique to core-collapsed clusters, which otherwise retain few BHs.},

	Abstract = {Model atmospheres form the basis for the interpretation of stellar spectra. A major problem in those model calculations is to establish the temperature stratification from the condition of radiative equilibrium. Dealing with non-LTE models for spherically expanding atmospheres of Wolf-Rayet stars, we developed a new temperature correction method. Its basic idea dates back to 1955 when it was proposed by Uns{\"o}ld for grey, static and plane-parallel atmospheres in LTE. The equations were later generalized to the non-grey case by Lucy. In the present paper we furthermore drop the Eddington approximation, proceed to spherical geometry and allow for expansion of the atmosphere. Finally the concept of an ``approximate lambda operator'' is employed to speed up the convergence. Tests for Wolf-Rayet type models demonstrate that the method works fine even in situations of strong non-LTE.},

@article{Meynet:1994dd,
	Abstract = {Most outputs of massive star evolution critically depend on the mass loss rates. In order to broaden the comparison basis and to illustrate the effects of different mass loss rates, we have computed new sets of models, with initial masses between 12 and 120 Msun_, and metallicities, Z, between 0.001 and 0.040, with a mass loss rate increased by a factor of two during the phases when the stellar winds are believed to be essentially driven by the radiation pressure. A moderate core-overshooting and the new radiative opacities from Iglesias et al. (1992) and Kurucz (1991) were taken into account. These models complete the homogeneous and extended theoretical database formed by the previous grids of this series, computed by Schaller et al. (1992) for Z=0.020 and Z=0.001, by Schaerer et al. (1992, 1993) for Z=0.008 and Z=0.040 and by Charbonnel et al. (1993) for Z=0.004. This paper closes this series. Of particular interest is the predicted behaviour of metal rich stars such as may be found in the inner regions of our Galaxy. New evolutionary connexions are found, in particular we show that the most massive and metal rich stars may spend a relatively long time as He and N enriched stars and may even end their evolution as white dwarfs.},

@article{Reines:2010zi,
	Abstract = {In this spectroscopic study of infant massive star clusters, we find that continuum emission from ionized gas rivals the stellar luminosity at optical wavelengths. In addition, we find that nebular line emission is significant in many commonly used broadband Hubble Space Telescope (HST) filters including the F814W I-band, the F555W V-band, and the F435W B-band. Two young massive clusters (YMCs) in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4449 were targeted for follow-up spectroscopic observations after Reines et al. discovered an F814W I-band excess in their photometric study of radio-detected clusters in the galaxy. The spectra were obtained with the Dual Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) on the 3.5 m Apache Point Observatory (APO) telescope and have a spectral range of ~3800-9800 {\AA}. We supplement these data with HST and Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry of the clusters. By comparing our data to the Starburst99 and GALEV evolutionary synthesis models, we find that nebular continuum emission competes with the stellar light in our observations and that the relative contribution from the nebular continuum is largest in the U- and I-bands, where the Balmer (3646 {\AA}) and Paschen jumps (8207 {\AA}) are located. The spectra also exhibit strong line emission including the [S III] lambdalambda9069, 9532 lines in the HST F814W I-band. We find that the combination of nebular continuum and line emission can account for the F814W I-band excess previously found by Reines et al. In an effort to provide a benchmark for estimating the impact of ionized gas emission on photometric observations of young massive stellar populations, we compute the relative contributions of the stellar continuum, nebular continuum, and emission lines to the total observed flux of a 3 Myr old cluster through various HST filter/instrument combinations, including filters in the Wide Field Camera 3. We urge caution when comparing observations of YMCs to evolutionary synthesis models since nebular continuum and line emission can have a large impact on magnitudes and colors of young (lsim5 Myr) clusters, significantly affecting inferred properties such as ages, masses and extinctions.},

	Abstract = {We use high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging observations of the young (~15-25 Myr old) star cluster NGC 1818 in the Large Magellanic Cloud to derive an estimate for the binary fraction of F stars (1.3 < M sstarf/M sun < 1.6). This study provides the strongest constraints yet on the binary fraction in a young star cluster in a low-metallicity environment ([Fe/H] ~ -0.4 dex). Employing artificial-star tests, we develop a simple method that can efficiently measure the probabilities of stellar blends and superpositions from the observed stellar catalog. We create synthetic color-magnitude diagrams matching the fundamental parameters of NGC 1818, with different binary fractions and mass-ratio distributions. We find that this method is sensitive to binaries with mass ratios q >~ 0.4. For binaries with F-star primaries and mass ratios q > 0.4, the binary fraction is ~0.35. This suggests a total binary fraction for F stars of 0.55 to unity, depending on assumptions about the form of the mass-ratio distribution at low q.},

	Abstract = {The importance of nonuniform extinction in open star clusters of intermediate age is studied on the basis of photoelectric UBV measurements in open clusters catalogued by Mermilliod (1975) and of Wallenquist's study (1975) of the presence of absorbing matter by star counts in the fields of open clusters. It is found that clusters having less uniform projected stellar density on the sky are also those which present the largest dispersion in the two-color diagram. The major causes of dispersion in the photometric sequences are discussed and it is shown that the differential extinction is important not only in the case of very young clusters, but also in some clusters older than 50 million years. The effects of stellar rotation, stellar duplicity, and the limited precision of the measures can explain the observed dispersion in the least reddened clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present optical photometric and polarimetric observations of stars toward NGC 1931 with the aim of deriving cluster parameters such as distance, reddening, age, and luminosity/mass function as well as understanding dust properties and star formation in the region. The distance to the cluster is found to be 2.3 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc and the reddening E(B - V) in the region is found to be variable. The stellar density contours reveal two clusters in the region. The observations suggest a differing reddening law within the cluster region. Polarization efficiency of the dust grains toward the direction of the cluster is found to be less than that for the general diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). The slope of the mass function (-0.98 $\pm$ 0.22) in the southern region in the mass range of 0.8 < M/M &sun; < 9.8 is found to be shallower in comparison to that in the northern region (-1.26 $\pm$ 0.23), which is comparable to the Salpeter value (-1.35). The K-band luminosity function (KLF) of the region is found to be comparable to the average value of the slope (~0.4) for young clusters obtained by Lada & Lada; however, the slope of the KLF is steeper in the northern region as compared to the southern region. The region is probably ionized by two B2 main-sequence-type stars. The mean age of the young stellar objects (YSOs) is found to be 2 $\pm$ 1 Myr, which suggests that the identified YSOs could be younger than the ionizing sources of the region. The morphology of the region, the distribution and ages of the YSOs, and ionizing sources indicate a triggered star formation in the region.},

	Abstract = {A precise interstellar dust extinction law is critically important to interpret observations. There are two indicators of extinction: the color excess ratio (CER) and the relative extinction. Compared to the CER, the wavelength-dependent relative extinction is more challenging to be determined. In this work, we combine spectroscopic, astrometric, and photometric data to derive high-precision CERs and relative extinction from optical to mid-infrared (IR) bands. A group of 61,111 red clump (RC) stars are selected as tracers by stellar parameters from the Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment survey. The multiband photometric data are collected from Gaia, APASS, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Pan-STARRS1, Two Micron All Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer surveys. For the first time, we calibrate the curvature of CERs in determining CERs E(lambda - G RP)/E(G BP - G RP) from color excess--color excess diagrams. Through elaborate uncertainty analysis, we conclude that the precision of our CERs is significantly improved (sigma < 0.015). With parallaxes from Gaia DR2, we calculate the relative extinction {A}{GBP}/{A}{GRP} for 5051 RC stars. By combining the CERs with the {A}{GBP}/{A}{GRP}, the optical--mid-IR extinction A  lambda /{A}{GRP} has been determined in a total of 21 bands. Given no bias toward any specific environment, our extinction law represents the average extinction law with the total-to-selective extinction ratio R V = 3.16 $\pm$ 0.15. Our observed extinction law supports an adjustment in parameters of the CCM R V = 3.1 curve, together with the near-IR (NIR) power-law index alpha = 2.07 $\pm$ 0.03. The relative extinction values of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIR bandpasses are predicted in 2.5% precision. As the observed reddening/extinction tracks are curved, the curvature correction needs to be considered when applying extinction correction.},

	Abstract = {The initial-final mass relation represents a mapping between the mass of a white dwarf remnant and the mass that the hydrogen-burning main-sequence star that created it once had. The empirical relation thus far has been constrained using a sample of ~40 stars in young open clusters, ranging in initial mass from ~2.75 to 7 M&sun;, and shows a general trend that connects higher mass main-sequence stars with higher mass white dwarfs. In this paper, we present CFHT CFH12K photometric and Keck LRIS multiobject spectroscopic observations of a sample of 22 white dwarfs in two older open clusters, NGC 7789 (t = 1.4 Gyr) and NGC 6819 (t = 2.5 Gyr). We measure masses for the highest signal-to-noise ratio spectra by fitting the Balmer lines to atmosphere models and place the first direct constraints on the low-mass end of the initial-final mass relation. Our results indicate that the observed general trend at higher masses continues down to low masses, with Minitial = 1.6 M&sun; main-sequence stars forming Mfinal = 0.54 M&sun; white dwarfs. When added to our new data from the very old cluster NGC 6791, the relation is extended down to Minitial = 1.16 M&sun; (corresponding to Mfinal = 0.53 M&sun;). This extension of the relation represents a fourfold increase in the total number of hydrogen-burning stars for which the integrated mass loss can now be calculated from empirical data, assuming a Salpeter initial mass function. The new leverage at the low-mass end is used to derive a purely empirical initial-final mass relation. The sample of white dwarfs in these clusters also shows several interesting systems that we discuss further: a DB (helium) white dwarf, a magnetic white dwarf, a DAB (mixed hydrogen/helium atmosphere or a double degenerate DA+DB) white dwarf(s), and two possible equal-mass DA double degenerate binary systems.},

The method permits accurate distributions of stars in the theoretical color-magnitude diagram to be computed for any stellar population and thereby circumvent the problems faced by earlier techniques. A set of evolutionary tracks extending from the ZAMS up to the beginning of the white-dwarf cooling sequence is compiled to optimize the models. Comparison of model predictions with observational data leads to the conclusion that the isochrone synthesis can reproduce the observed colors of stellar populations of ages from a few tens of millions of yr to a Hubble time.},

@article{Leitherer:2014la,
	Abstract = {We present a new set of synthesis models for stellar populations obtained with Starburst99 and based on new stellar evolutionary tracks with rotation. We discuss models with zero rotation velocity and with velocities of 40% of the break-up velocity on the zero-age main-sequence. These values are expected to bracket realistic rotation velocity distributions in stellar populations. The new rotating models for massive stars are more luminous and hotter due to a larger convective core and enhanced surface abundances. This results in pronounced changes in the integrated spectral energy distribution of a population containing massive stars. The changes are most significant at the shortest wavelengths where an increase of the ionizing luminosity by up to a factor of five is predicted. We also show that high equivalent widths of recombination lines may not necessarily indicate a very young age but can be achieved at ages as late as ~107 yr. Comparison of these two boundary cases (0% and 40% of the break-up velocity) will allow users to evaluate the effects of rotation and provide guidance for calibrating the stellar evolution models. We also introduce a new theoretical ultraviolet spectral library built from the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet atmospheres. Its purpose is to help identify signatures of Wolf-Rayet stars in the ultraviolet whose strength is sensitive to the particulars of the evolution models. The new models are available for solar and one-seventh solar metallicities. A complete suite of models can be generated on the Starburst99 Web site. The updated Starburst99 package can be retrieved from that Web site as well.},

	Abstract = {We have incorporated the latest release of the Padova models into the evolutionary synthesis code Starburst99. The Padova tracks were extended to include the full asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolution until the final thermal pulse over the mass range 0.9-5 Msolar. With this addition, Starburst99 accounts for all stellar phases that contribute to the integrated light of a stellar population with arbitrary age from the extreme-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. AGB stars are important for ages between 0.1 and 2 Gyr, with their contribution increasing at longer wavelengths. We investigate similarities and differences between the model predictions by the Geneva and the Padova tracks. The differences are particularly pronounced at ages >1 Gyr, when incompleteness sets in for the Geneva models. We also perform detailed comparisons with the predictions of other major synthesis codes and find excellent agreement. Our synthesized optical colors are compared to observations of old, intermediate-age, and young populations. Excellent agreement is found for the old globular cluster system of NGC 5128 and for old and intermediate-age clusters in NGC 4038/4039. In contrast, the models fail for red supergiant-dominated populations with subsolar abundances. This failure can be traced back to incorrect red supergiant parameters in the stellar evolutionary tracks. Our models and the synthesis code are publicly available as version 5.0 of Starburst99 at http://www.stsci.edu/science/starburst99.},

	Abstract = {The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the nearest site of ongoing massive star formation, which allows us to study the kinematics and dynamics of the region in detail and constrain star formation theories. Using HST ACS/WFPC2/WFC3IR and Keck II NIRC2 data, we have measured the proper motions of 701 stars within an ˜6' × 6' field of view around the center of the ONC. We have found more than 10 escaping star candidates, concentrated predominantly at the core of the cluster. The proper motions of the bound stars are consistent with a normal distribution, albeit elongated north-south along the Orion filament, with proper-motion dispersions of ({sigma }mu ,{alpha * },{sigma }mu ,delta )=(0.83+/- 0.02,1.12+/- 0.03) mas yr-1 or intrinsic velocity dispersions of ({sigma }v,{alpha * },{sigma }v,delta )=(1.57+/- 0.04,2.12+/- 0.06) km s-1 assuming a distance of 400 pc to the ONC. The cluster shows no evidence for tangential-to-radial anisotropy. Our velocity dispersion profile agrees with the prediction from the observed stellar + gas density profile from Da Rio et al., indicating that the ONC is in virial equilibrium. This finding suggests that the cluster was formed with a low star formation efficiency per dynamical timescale based on comparisons with current star formation theories. Our survey also recovered high-velocity IR sources BN, x and n in the BN/KL region. The estimated location of the first two sources ˜500 yr ago agrees with that of the radio source I, consistent with their proposed common origin from a multistellar disintegration. However, source n appears to have a small proper motion and is unlikely to have been involved in the event.},

	Abstract = {We present new models for low-mass stars down to the hydrogen-burning limit that consistently couple atmosphere and interior structures, thereby superseding the widely used BCAH98 models. The new models include updated molecular linelists and solar abundances, as well as atmospheric convection parameters calibrated on 2D/3D radiative hydrodynamics simulations. Comparison of these models with observations in various colour-magnitude diagrams for various ages shows significant improvement over previous generations of models. The new models can solve flaws that are present in the previous ones, such as the prediction of optical colours that are too blue compared to M dwarf observations. They can also reproduce the four components of the young quadruple system LkCa 3 in a colour-magnitude diagram with one single isochrone, in contrast to any presently existing model. In this paper we also highlight the need for consistency when comparing models and observations, with the necessity of using evolutionary models and colours based on the same atmospheric structures.},

	Abstract = {Context.  Aims: The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the outstanding quality of the second data release of the Gaia mission and its power for constraining many different aspects of the dynamics of the satellites of the Milky Way. We focus here on determining the proper motions of 75 Galactic globular clusters, nine dwarf spheroidal galaxies, one ultra-faint system, and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.  Methods: Using data extracted from the Gaia archive, we derived the proper motions and parallaxes for these systems, as well as their uncertainties. We demonstrate that the errors, statistical and systematic, are relatively well understood. We integrated the orbits of these objects in three different Galactic potentials, and characterised their properties. We present the derived proper motions, space velocities, and characteristic orbital parameters in various tables to facilitate their use by the astronomical community.  Results: Our limited and straightforward analyses have allowed us for example to (i) determine absolute and very precise proper motions for globular clusters; (ii) detect clear rotation signatures in the proper motions of at least five globular clusters; (iii) show that the satellites of the Milky Way are all on high-inclination orbits, but that they do not share a single plane of motion; (iv) derive a lower limit for the mass of the Milky Way of 9.1-2.6+6.2 × 1011 M&sun; based on the assumption that the Leo I dwarf spheroidal is bound; (v) derive a rotation curve for the Large Magellanic Cloud based solely on proper motions that is competitive with line-of-sight velocity curves, now using many orders of magnitude more sources; and (vi) unveil the dynamical effect of the bar on the motions of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  Conclusions: All these results highlight the incredible power of the Gaia astrometric mission, and in particular of its second data release.

	Abstract = {We take advantage of the exquisite quality of the Hubble Space Telescope astro-photometric catalog of the core of omegaCen presented in the first paper of this series to derive a high-resolution, high-precision, high-accuracy differential-reddening map of the field. The map has a spatial resolution of 2 × 2 arcsec2 over a total field of view of about 4.'3 × 4.'3. The differential reddening itself is estimated via an iterative procedure using five distinct color-magnitude diagrams, which provided consistent results to within the 0.1% level. Assuming an average reddening value E(B - V) = 0.12, the differential reddening within the cluster's core can vary by up to $\pm$10%, with a typical standard deviation of about 4%. Our differential-reddening map is made available to the astronomical community in the form of a multi-extension FITS file. This differential-reddening map is essential for a detailed understanding of the multiple stellar populations of omegaCen, as presented in the next paper in this series. Moreover, it provides unique insight into the level of small spatial-scale extinction variations in the Galactic foreground.  Based on archival observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Context: T-type dwarfs present a broad and shallow absorption feature centred around 6950 {\AA} in the blue wing of the K doublet at 0.77 mum which resembles in depth and shape the satellite absorption predicted by detailed collisional broadening profiles. In our previous work, the position of the predicted line satellite was however somewhat too blue compared to the observed feature.   Aims: In this paper, we investigate whether new calculations of the energy surfaces of the potentials in the K-H2 system, including spin-orbit coupling, result in a closer coincidence of the satellite with the observed position. We also investigate the extent to which CaH absorption bands contribute to the feature and at what T_eff these respective opacity sources predominate.   Methods: We present model atmospheres and synthetic spectra, including gravitational settling for an improved description of depth-dependent abundances of refractory elements, and based on new K-H2 line profiles using improved interaction potentials.  Results: By comparison with a high signal-to-noise optical spectrum of the T1 dwarf \varepsilon Indi Ba, we find that these new models do reproduce the observed feature, while CaH does not contribute for the atmospheric parameters considered. We also find that CaH is settled out so deep into the atmosphere that even turbulent vertical mixing would appear insufficient to bring significant amounts of CaH to the observable photosphere in dwarfs of later type than  L5.   Conclusions: We conclude that previous identification of the feature at this location in the spectra of T dwarfs as well as the latest L dwarfs with CaH was erroneous, as expected on physical grounds: calcium has already condensed onto grains in early L dwarfs and thus should have settled out of the photosphere in cooler brown dwarfs. This finding revokes one of the observational verifications for the cloud-clearing theory assumption: a gradual clearing of the cloud cover in early T dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {Brown  dwarf   atmospheres  form  molecules,   then  high  temperature condensates (corundum, titanates,  silicates, and iron compounds), and then low temperature  condensates (ices) as they cool  down over time. These  produce large  opacities which  govern entirely  their spectral energy  distribution.   Just as  it  is  important  to know  molecular opacities (TiO, H_2O, CH_4,  etc.) with accuracy, it is imperative to understand   the  interplay  of   processes  (e.g.   condensation, sedimentation, coagulation, convection) that determines the radial and size  distribution of grains.   Limiting case  models have  shown that young, hot brown (L) dwarfs  form dust mostly in equilibrium, while at much cooler  stages (late T  dwarfs) all high  temperature condensates have  sedimented  out of  their  photospheres.   But  this process  is gradual and  all intermediate  classes of brown  dwarfs can  partly be understood in terms of partial sedimentation of dust.  With new models accounting for these processes, we  describe the effects they may have upon brown dwarf spectral properties.},

	Abstract = {In 1979, Menten and coworkers accurately determined the position of Sgr A* on an infrared image by aligning the infrared image with positions measured for SiO masers, associated with infrared-bright evolved stars, at radio wavelengths. We now report greatly improved radio positions and, for the first time, proper motions of many stellar SiO masers at the Galactic center. These positions and motions, coupled with better infrared imaging, allow a much improved location of Sgr A* on infrared images. With current data, infrared stars can be placed in a reference frame tied to Sgr A*, to an accuracy of ~10 mas in position and ~1 mas yr-1 in motion. The position of Sgr A* is, within uncertainties, consistent with stellar accelerations and the measured orbital focus of the star S2. The star S2 was observed within 16 mas (~130 AU in projection) of Sgr A* on 2002 May 2. Finally, we find that the central stellar cluster moves with Sgr A* to within ~70 km s-1.},

@article{Hawkins:2017ty,
	Abstract = {Distances to individual stars in our own Galaxy are critical in order to piece together the nature of its velocity and spatial structure. Core helium burning red clump (RC) stars have similar luminosities, are abundant throughout the Galaxy and thus constitute good standard candles. We build a hierarchical probabilistic model to quantify the quality of RC stars as standard candles using parallax measurements from the first Gaia data release. A unique aspect of our methodology is to fully account for (and marginalize over) parallax, photometry and dust correction uncertainties, which lead to more robust results than standard approaches. We determine the absolute magnitude and intrinsic dispersion of the RC in 2MASS bands J, H, Ks, Gaia G band and WISE bands W1, W2, W3 and W4. We find that the absolute magnitude of the RC is -1.61 $\pm$ 0.01 (in Ks), +0.44 $\pm$ 0.01 (in G), -0.93 $\pm$ 0.01 (in J), -1.46 $\pm$ 0.01 (in H), -1.68 $\pm$ 0.02 (in W1), -1.69 $\pm$ 0.02 (in W2), -1.67 $\pm$ 0.02 (in W3) and -1.76 $\pm$ 0.01 mag (in W4). The mean intrinsic dispersion is ˜0.17 $\pm$ 0.03 mag across all bands (yielding a typical distance precision of ˜8 per cent). Thus RC stars are reliable and precise standard candles. In addition, we have also re-calibrated the zero-point of the absolute magnitude of the RC in each band, which provides a benchmark for future studies to estimate distances to RC stars. Finally, the parallax error shrinkage in the hierarchical model outlined in this work can be used to obtain more precise parallaxes than Gaia for the most distant RC stars across the Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {The centre of our Galaxy is one of the most studied and yet enigmatic places in the Universe. At a distance of about 8 kpc from our Sun, the Galactic centre (GC) is the ideal environment to study the extreme processes that take place in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Despite the hostile environment, several tens of early-type stars populate the central parsec of our Galaxy. A fraction of them lie in a thin ring with mild eccentricity and inner radius   ˜ 0.04  pc, while the S-stars, i.e. the   ˜ 30  stars closest to the SMBH (  lesssim 0.04  pc), have randomly oriented and highly eccentric orbits. The formation of such early-type stars has been a puzzle for a long time: molecular clouds should be tidally disrupted by the SMBH before they can fragment into stars. We review the main scenarios proposed to explain the formation and the dynamical evolution of the early-type stars in the GC. In particular, we discuss the most popular in situ scenarios (accretion disc fragmentation and molecular cloud disruption) and migration scenarios (star cluster inspiral and Hills mechanism). We focus on the most pressing challenges that must be faced to shed light on the process of star formation in the vicinity of a SMBH.},

	Abstract = {We present a rapid binary-evolution algorithm that enables modelling of even the most complex binary systems. In addition to all aspects of single-star evolution, features such as mass transfer, mass accretion, common-envelope evolution, collisions, supernova kicks and angular momentum loss mechanisms are included. In particular, circularization and synchronization of the orbit by tidal interactions are calculated for convective, radiative and degenerate damping mechanisms. We use this algorithm to study the formation and evolution of various binary systems. We also investigate the effect that tidal friction has on the outcome of binary evolution. Using the rapid binary code, we generate a series of large binary populations and evaluate the formation rate of interesting individual species and events. By comparing the results for populations with and without tidal friction, we quantify the hitherto ignored systematic effect of tides and show that modelling of tidal evolution in binary systems is necessary in order to draw accurate conclusions from population synthesis work. Tidal synchronism is important but, because orbits generally circularize before Roche lobe overflow, the outcome of the interactions of systems with the same semilatus rectum is almost independent of eccentricity. It is not necessary to include a distribution of eccentricities in population synthesis of interacting binaries; however, the initial separations should be distributed according to the observed distribution of semilatera recta rather than periods or semimajor axes.},

	Abstract = {In an effort to determine statistical properties of visual pre-main sequence (PMS) binaries, we have carried out an extensive systematic CCD imaging survey of young low-mass stars in nearby southern dark clouds, all at about 150 pc distance. The observations were made with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) New Technology Telescope at a wavelength of 0.9 micrometers under sub-arcsecond seeing conditions. Among the 238 young stars systematically observed, we detect 37 binaries (22 new discoveries) and 1 triple system (Sz 30, also new) in the range of separations between 1 arcseconds and 12 arcseconds. Further binaries were identified outside these limits, including 6 sub-arcsec binaries. The lower limit of 1 arcseconds was imposed to ensure completeness of our sample, which we have tested through numerical simulations. Thus, we find a frequency of 16% for PMS binaries with projected separations between about 150 AU and 1800 AU. We compare these observations with the known main sequence (MS) distributions of G and K dwarfs in the same interval of separations, and find an apparent excess of PMS binaries. Under the assumption that total PMS and MS binary frequencies should be the same, the excess may imply that binary orbits undergo secular evolution towards the main sequence. We briefly discuss implications of our results for the star formation efficiency and the initial mass function. Our data suggest that in T associations binary star formation appears to be the rule, while the formation of single stars is probably the exception. We have in the same way searched for multiplicity in this extended sample. As a result, we have additionally discovered another 18 new PMS binaries and have reobserved another 32 already known PMS binaries. Therefore, in total we here provide information (component separations, brightness-ratios, and position angles) on 87 PMS binaries and 1 triple, approximately half of which are newly discovered.},

	Abstract = {J, H, K, and L photometry for the star's in the central ˜2' (˜ 5 pc) of the Galaxy are presented. Using the observed J - H, H - K, and K - L colors and assumed intrinsic colors, we determine the interstellar extinction at 2.2 mum (AK) for approximately 1100 individual stars. The mean AK(=3.3 mag) is similar to previous results, but we find that the reddening is highly variable, and some stars are likely to be seen through AK > 6 mag. The dereddened K-band luminosity function points to a significantly brighter component to the stellar population (>1.5 mag at K) than found in the stellar population in Baade's window, confirming previous work done at lower spatial resolution. The observed flux of all Galactic center stars with estimated K0 (dereddened magnitude) <=7.0 mag is ˜25% of the total in the 2' x 2' field.  Our observations confirm the recent finding that several bright M stars in the Galactic center are variable. Our photometry also establishes the near-infrared variability of the M1-2 supergiant, IRS 7.},

	Abstract = {We present a metallicity analysis of 83 late-type giants within the central 1 pc of the Milky Way. K-band spectroscopy of these stars was obtained with the medium spectral resolution integral-field spectrograph NIFS on Gemini North using laser-guided star adaptive optics. Using spectral template fitting with the MARCS synthetic spectral grid, we find that there is a large variation in the metallicity, with stars ranging from [M/H] < -1.0 to above solar metallicity. About 6% of the stars have [M/H] < -0.5. This result is in contrast to previous observations with smaller samples that show stars at the Galactic center having approximately solar metallicity with only small variations. Our current measurement uncertainties are dominated by systematics in the model, especially at [M/H] > 0, where there are stellar lines not represented in the model. However, the conclusion that there are low-metallicity stars, as well as large variations in metallicity, is robust. The metallicity may be an indicator of the origin of these stars. The low-metallicity population is consistent with that of globular clusters in the Milky Way, but their small fraction likely means that globular cluster infall is not the dominant mechanism for forming the Milky Way nuclear star cluster. The majority of stars are at or above solar metallicity, which suggests they were formed closer to the Galactic center or from the disk. In addition, our results indicate that it will be important for star formation history analyses using red giants at the Galactic center to consider the effect of varying metallicity.},

	Abstract = {As the closest example of a galactic nucleus, the Galactic center (GC) presents an exquisite laboratory for learning about supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their environment. We describe several exciting new research directions that, over the next 10 years, hold the potential to answer some of the biggest scientific questions raised in recent decades: Is General Relativity (GR) the correct description for supermassive black holes? What is the nature of star formation in extreme environments? How do stars and compact objects dynamically interact with the supermassive black hole? What physical processes drive gas accretion in low-luminosity black holes? We describe how the high sensitivity, angular resolution, and astrometric precision offered by the next generation of large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics will help us answer these questions. First, it will be possible to obtain precision measurements of stellar orbits in the Galaxy's central potential, providing both tests of GR in the unexplored regime near a SMBH and measurements of the extended dark matter distribution that is predicted to exist at the GC. Second, we will probe stellar populations at the GC to significantly lower masses than are possible today, down to brown dwarfs. Their structure and dynamics will provide an unprecedented view of the stellar cusp around the SMBH and will distinguish between models of star formation in this extreme environment. This increase in depth will also allow us to measure the currently unknown population of compact remnants at the GC by observing their effects on luminous sources. Third, uncertainties on the mass of and distance to the SMBH can be improved by a factor of $\sim$10. Finally, we can also study the near-infrared accretion onto the black hole at unprecedented sensitivity and time resolution, which can reveal the underlying physics of black hole accretion.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution near-infrared spectra, obtained with the NIRSPEC spectrograph on the W. M. Keck II Telescope, of a collection of hot, massive stars within the central 25" of the Galactic center. We have identified a total of 21 emission-line stars, seven of which are new radial velocity detections, with five of those being classified as He I emission-line stars for the first time. These stars fall into two categories based on their spectral properties: (1) those with narrow 2.112, 2.113 mum He I doublet absorption lines, and (2) those with broad 2.058 mum He I emission lines. These data have the highest spectral resolution ever obtained for these sources and, as a result, both components of the absorption doublet are separately resolved for the first time. We use these spectral features to measure radial velocities. The majority of the measured radial velocities have relative errors of 20 km s-1, smaller than those previously obtained with proper-motion or radial velocity measurements for similar stellar samples in the Galactic center. The radial velocities estimated from the He I absorption doublet are more robust than those previously estimated from the 2.058 mum emission line, since they do not suffer from confusion due to emission from the surrounding ISM. Using this velocity information, we agree with previous stellar velocity studies that the stars are orbiting in a somewhat coherent manner but are not as defined into a disk or disks as previously thought. Finally, multiepoch radial velocity measurements for IRS 16NE show a change in its velocity, presumably due to an unseen stellar companion.},

	Abstract = {The colour-magnitude diagrams of resolved single stellar populations, such as open and globular clusters, have provided the best natural laboratories to test stellar evolution theory. Whilst a variety of techniques have been used to infer the basic properties of these simple populations, systematic uncertainties arise from the purely geometrical degeneracy produced by the similar shape of isochrones of different ages and metallicities. Here we present an objective and robust statistical technique which lifts this degeneracy to a great extent through the use of a key observable: the number of stars along the isochrone. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations we show that, for instance, we can infer the four main parameters (age, metallicity, distance and reddening) in an objective way, along with robust confidence intervals and their full covariance matrix. We show that systematic uncertainties due to field contamination, unresolved binaries, initial or present-day stellar mass function are either negligible or well under control. This technique provides, for the first time, a proper way to infer with unprecedented accuracy the fundamental properties of simple stellar populations, in an easy-to-implement algorithm.},

	Abstract = {We present a Bayesian method to determine simultaneously the age, metallicity, distance modulus, and interstellar reddening by dust of any resolved stellar population, by comparing the observed and synthetic colour magnitude diagrams on a star by star basis, with no need to bin the data into a carefully selected magnitude grid. We test the method with mock stellar populations, and show that it works correctly even for scarce stellar populations with only one or two hundred stars above the main sequence turn-off. If the population is the result of two star formation bursts, we can infer the contribution of each event to the total stellar population. The code works automatically and has already been used to study massive amounts of Magellanic clouds photometric data. In this paper we analyse in detail three Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters and 6 Ultra Faint Dwarf Galaxies. For these galaxies we recover physical parameters in agreement with those quoted in the literature, age ˜13.7 Gyr and a very low metallicity log Z˜ -4. Searching for multiple populations in these galaxies, we find, at a very low significance level, signs of a double stellar population for Ursa Major I: a dominant old population and a younger one which contributes ˜25 per cent of the stars, in agreement with independent results from other authors.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate a new Bayesian technique to invert color-magnitude diagrams of main-sequence and white dwarf stars to reveal the underlying cluster properties of age, distance, metallicity, and line-of-sight absorption, as well as individual stellar masses. The advantages our technique has over traditional analyses of color-magnitude diagrams are objectivity, precision, and explicit dependence on prior knowledge of cluster parameters. Within the confines of a given set of often-used models of stellar evolution, a single mapping of initial to final masses, and white dwarf cooling, and assuming photometric errors that one could reasonably achieve with the Hubble Space Telescope, our technique yields exceptional precision for even modest numbers of cluster stars. For clusters with 50-400 members and one to a few dozen white dwarfs, we find typical internal errors of sigma([Fe/H])<=0.03 dex, sigma(m-MV)<=0.02 mag, and sigma(AV)<=0.01 mag. We derive cluster white dwarf ages with internal errors of typically only 10% for clusters with only three white dwarfs and almost always <=5% with 10 white dwarfs. These exceptional precisions will allow us to test white dwarf cooling models and standard stellar evolution models through observations of white dwarfs in open and globular clusters.

	Abstract = {Context. The second Gaia data release (Gaia DR2) provides precise five-parameter astrometric data (positions, proper motions, and parallaxes) for an unprecedented number of sources (more than 1.3 billion, mostly stars). This new wealth of data will enable the undertaking of statistical analysis of many astrophysical problems that were previously infeasible for lack of reliable astrometry, and in particular because of the lack of parallaxes. However, the use of this wealth of astrometric data comes with a specific challenge: how can the astrophysical parameters of interest be properly inferred from these data?  Aims: The main focus of this paper, but not the only focus, is the issue of the estimation of distances from parallaxes, possibly combined with other information. We start with a critical review of the methods traditionally used to obtain distances from parallaxes and their shortcomings. Then we provide guidelines on how to use parallaxes more efficiently to estimate distances by using Bayesian methods. In particular we also show that negative parallaxes, or parallaxes with relatively large uncertainties still contain valuable information. Finally, we provide examples that show more generally how to use astrometric data for parameter estimation, including the combination of proper motions and parallaxes and the handling of covariances in the uncertainties.  Methods: The paper contains examples based on simulated Gaia data to illustrate the problems and the solutions proposed. Furthermore, the developments and methods proposed in the paper are linked to a set of tutorials included in the Gaia archive documentation that provide practical examples and a good starting point for the application of the recommendations to actual problems. In all cases the source code for the analysis methods is provided.  Results: Our main recommendation is to always treat the derivation of (astro-)physical parameters from astrometric data, in particular when parallaxes are involved, as an inference problem which should preferably be handled with a full Bayesian approach.  Conclusions: Gaia will provide fundamental data for many fields of astronomy. Further data releases will provide more data, and more precise data. Nevertheless, to fully use the potential it will always be necessary to pay careful attention to the statistical treatment of parallaxes and proper motions. The purpose of this paper is to help astronomers find the correct approach.},

	Abstract = {Context. The Gaia satellite will observe about one billion stars and other point-like sources. The astrometric core solution will determine the astrometric parameters (position, parallax, and proper motion) for a subset of these sources, using a global solution approach which must also include a large number of parameters for the satellite attitude and optical instrument. The accurate and efficient implementation of this solution is an extremely demanding task, but crucial for the outcome of the mission.  Aims: We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the mathematical and physical models applicable to this solution, as well as its numerical and algorithmic framework.  Methods: The astrometric core solution is a simultaneous least-squares estimation of about half a billion parameters, including the astrometric parameters for some 100 million well-behaved so-called primary sources. The global nature of the solution requires an iterative approach, which can be broken down into a small number of distinct processing blocks (source, attitude, calibration and global updating) and auxiliary processes (including the frame rotator and selection of primary sources). We describe each of these processes in some detail, formulate the underlying models, from which the observation equations are derived, and outline the adopted numerical solution methods with due consideration of robustness and the structure of the resulting system of equations. Appendices provide brief introductions to some important mathematical tools (quaternions and B-splines for the attitude representation, and a modified Cholesky algorithm for positive semidefinite problems) and discuss some complications expected in the real mission data.  Results: A complete software system called AGIS (Astrometric Global Iterative Solution) is being built according to the methods described in the paper. Based on simulated data for 2 million primary sources we present some initial results, demonstrating the basic mathematical and numerical validity of the approach and, by a reasonable extrapolation, its practical feasibility in terms of data management and computations for the real mission.},

	Abstract = {It is usually assumed that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) takes a universal form and that there exists a direct mapping between this and the distribution of natal core masses (the core mass function, CMF). The IMF and CMF have been best characterized in the Solar neighborhood. Beyond 500~pc from the Sun, in diverse environments where metallicity varies and massive star feedback may dominate, the IMF has been measured only incompletely and imprecisely, while the CMF has hardly been measured at all. In order to establish if the IMF and CMF are indeed universal and related to each other, it is necessary to: 1) perform multi-wavelength large-scale imaging and spectroscopic surveys of different environments across the Galaxy; 2) require an angular resolution of < 0.1'' in the optical/near-IR for stars and < 5'' in the far-IR for cores; 3) achieve far-IR sensitivities to probe 0.1~Msol cores at 2--3 kpc.},

	Abstract = {We present a large set of radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in self-gravitating, turbulent molecular clouds, modelling the formation of individual massive stars, including their UV radiation feedback. We consider a grid of simulations varying the cloud masses between m_gas = 10^3 M_sun to 3e5 M_sun, and resolving scales between 200 AU to 2000 AU. We consider molecular clouds with gas mean number densities typical of those observed in the local universe and denser molecular clouds expected to exist in high-redshift galaxies. In this paper, the first of a series, we focus on the analysis of the initial mass function (IMF), the star formation rate (SFR), and the total star formation efficiency (TSFE) in molecular clouds. These are the main results: i) We find that the observed Salpeter power-law slope and normalisation of the stellar IMF at the high-mass end can be reproduced if we assume that each star-forming gas clump (sink particle) fragments into stars producing on average a maximum stellar mass about 40% of the mass of the sink particle, while the remaining 60% is distributed into smaller mass stars. This empirical prescription, and an IMF reproducing a Chabrier IMF, can be obtained assuming that the sinks fragment according to a power-law mass function flatter than Salpeter, with log-slope Gamma sim 0.8. This result is in agreement with the observed mass function of dense cores in some molecular clouds. ii) The star formation law that best describes our set of simulation is drho_*/dt ~ rho_gas^1.5 if n_gas<n_cri ~ 10^3 cm^-3, and drho_*/dt ~ rho_gas^2.5 if n_gas > n_cri. The duration of the star formation episode of roughly 6 sound crossing times of the cloud radius (with c_s=10 km/s). iii) For gas at solar metallicity the TSFE in the cloud is f_*=2% (m_gas/10^4 M_sun)^0.4(1+n_gas/n_cri)^0.91, also in agreement with (ii).

	Abstract = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0 ×10-21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 sigma . The source lies at a luminosity distance of 41 0-180+160 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z =0.0 9-0.04+0.03 . In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 3 6-4+5M&sun; and 2 9-4+4M&sun; , and the final black hole mass is 6 2-4+4M&sun; , with 3. 0-0.5+0.5M&sun; c2 radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

	Abstract = {We present the first Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of M87, using observations from April 2017 at 1.3 mm wavelength. These images show a prominent ring with a diameter of ~40 muas, consistent with the size and shape of the lensed photon orbit encircling the ``shadow'' of a supermassive black hole. The ring is persistent across four observing nights and shows enhanced brightness in the south. To assess the reliability of these results, we implemented a two-stage imaging procedure. In the first stage, four teams, each blind to the others' work, produced images of M87 using both an established method (CLEAN) and a newer technique (regularized maximum likelihood). This stage allowed us to avoid shared human bias and to assess common features among independent reconstructions. In the second stage, we reconstructed synthetic data from a large survey of imaging parameters and then compared the results with the corresponding ground truth images. This stage allowed us to select parameters objectively to use when reconstructing images of M87. Across all tests in both stages, the ring diameter and asymmetry remained stable, insensitive to the choice of imaging technique. We describe the EHT imaging procedures, the primary image features in M87, and the dependence of these features on imaging assumptions.},

	Abstract = {The recent discovery of GW150914, the binary black hole merger detected by Advanced LIGO, has the potential to revolutionize observational astrophysics. But to fully utilize this new window into the Universe, we must compare these new observations to detailed models of binary black hole formation throughout cosmic time. Expanding upon our previous work [C. L. Rodriguez, M. Morscher, B. Pattabiraman, S. Chatterjee, C.-J. Haster, and F. A. Rasio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 051101 (2015).], we study merging binary black holes formed in globular clusters using our Monte Carlo approach to stellar dynamics. We have created a new set of 52 cluster models with different masses, metallicities, and radii to fully characterize the binary black hole merger rate. These models include all the relevant dynamical processes (such as two-body relaxation, strong encounters, and three-body binary formation) and agree well with detailed direct N -body simulations. In addition, we have enhanced our stellar evolution algorithms with updated metallicity-dependent stellar wind and supernova prescriptions, allowing us to compare our results directly to the most recent population synthesis predictions for merger rates from isolated binary evolution. We explore the relationship between a cluster's global properties and the population of binary black holes that it produces. In particular, we derive a numerically calibrated relationship between the merger times of ejected black hole binaries and a cluster's mass and radius. With our improved treatment of stellar evolution, we find that globular clusters can produce a significant population of massive black hole binaries that merge in the local Universe. We explore the masses and mass ratios of these binaries as a function of redshift, and find a merger rate of ˜5 Gpc-3yr-1 in the local Universe, with 80% of sources having total masses from 32 M&sun; to 64 M&sun;. Under standard assumptions, approximately one out of every seven binary black hole mergers in the local Universe will have originated in a globular cluster, but we also explore the sensitivity of this result to different assumptions for binary stellar evolution. If black holes were born with significant natal kicks, comparable to those of neutron stars, then the merger rate of binary black holes from globular clusters would be comparable to that from the field, with approximately 1 /2 of mergers originating in clusters. Finally we point out that population synthesis results for the field may also be modified by dynamical interactions of binaries taking place in dense star clusters which, unlike globular clusters, dissolved before the present day.},

	Abstract = {We show that the mass-segregation solution for the steady-state distribution of stars around a massive black hole (MBH) has two branches: the well known weak-segregation solution and a strong segregation solution, which is analyzed here for the first time. The nature of the solution depends on the heavy-to-light stellar mass ratio MH /ML and on the unbound population number ratio NH /NL , through the relaxational coupling parameter Delta = 4NHM 2  H /[NLM 2  L (3 + MH /ML )]. When the heavy stars are relatively common (Delta Gt 1), they scatter frequently on each other. This efficient self-coupling leads to weak mass segregation, where the stars form n∝ r^{-alpha_{M}} mass-dependent cusps near the MBH, with indices alpha H  = 7/4 for the heavy stars and 3/2 < alpha L  < 7/4 for the light stars (i.e. max(alpha H  - alpha L ) sime 1/4). However, when the heavy stars are relatively rare (Delta Lt 1), they scatter mostly on light stars, sink to the center by dynamical friction and settle into a much steeper cusp with 2 lsim alpha H  lsim 11/4, while the light stars form a 3/2 < alpha L  < 7/4 cusp, resulting in strong segregation (i.e., max(alpha H  - alpha L ) sime 1). We show that the present-day mass function of evolved stellar populations with a universal initial mass function (coeval or continuously star forming) separates into two distinct mass scales, ~1 M sun of main sequence and compact dwarfs, and ~10 M sun of stellar black holes (SBHs), and have Delta < 0.1. We conclude that it is likely that many relaxed galactic nuclei are strongly segregated. We review indications of strong segregation in observations of the Galactic center and in results of numeric simulations, and briefly list possible implications of a very high central concentration of SBHs around an MBH.},

	Abstract = {Context. Although the Milky Way nuclear star cluster (MWNSC) was discovered more than four decades ago, several of its key properties have not been determined unambiguously up to now because of the strong and spatially highly variable interstellar extinction toward the Galactic centre.  Aims: In this paper we aim at determining the shape, size, and luminosity/mass of the MWNSC.  Methods: To investigate the properties of the MWNSC, we used Spitzer/IRAC images at 3.6 and 4.5 mum, where interstellar extinction is at a minimum but the overall emission is still dominated by stars. We corrected the 4.5 mum image for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission with the help of the IRAC 8.0 mum map and for extinction with the help of a [3.6-4.5] colour map. Finally, we investigated the symmetry of the nuclear cluster and fit it with S{\'e}rsic, Moffat, and King models.  Results: We present an extinction map for the central ~ 300 × 200 pc2 of the Milky Way, as well as a PAH-emission- and extinction-corrected image of the stellar emission, with a resolution of about 0.20 pc. We find that the MWNSC appears in projection to be intrinsically point-symmetric, that it is significantly flattened, with its major axis aligned along the Galactic plane, and that it is centred on the black hole, Sagittarius A*. Its density follows the well known approximate rho ∝ r-2-law at distances of a few parsec from Sagittarius A*, but becomes as steep as rho ∝ r-3 at projected radii around 5 pc. We derive a half light radius of 4.2 $\pm$ 0.4 pc, a total luminosity of LMWNSC,4.5 mum = 4.1 $\pm$ 0.4 × 107 L&sun;, and a mass of MMWNSC = 2.5 $\pm$ 0.4 × 107 M&sun;.  Conclusions: The overall properties of the MWNSC agree well with the ones of its extragalactic counterparts, which underlines its role as a template for these objects. Its flattening agrees well with its previously established rotation parallel to Galactic rotation and suggests that it was formed by accretion of material that tended to fall in along the Galactic plane. Our findings support the in situ growth scenario for nuclear clusters and emphasise the need to increase the complexity of theoretical models for their formation and for the interaction between their stars and the central black hole in order to include rotation, axisymmetry, and growth in recurrent episodes.

	Abstract = {We obtain the basic properties of the nuclear cluster of the Milky Way. First, we investigate the structural properties by constructing a stellar density map of the central 1000" using extinction-corrected old star counts from VISTA, WFC3/IR, and VLT/NACO data. We describe the data using two components. The inner, slightly flattened (axis ratio of q=0.80+/- 0.04) component is the nuclear cluster, while the outer component corresponds to the stellar component of the circumnuclear zone. For the nuclear cluster, we measure a half-light radius of 178+/- 51\prime\prime ≈ 7+/- 2 pc and a luminosity of {M}{Ks}=-16.0+/- 0.5. Second, we measure detailed dynamics out to 4 pc. We obtain 10,351 proper motions from AO data, and 2513 radial velocities from VLT/SINFONI data. We determine the cluster mass by means of isotropic spherical Jeans modeling. We fix the distance to the Galactic Center and the mass of the supermassive black hole. We model the cluster either with a constant M/L or with a power law. For the latter case, we obtain a slope of 1.18 $\pm$ 0.06. We get a cluster mass within 100" of {M}100\prime\prime =(6.09+/- 0.53{| }{fix{R}0}+/- 0.97{| }{R0})× {10}6{M}&sun;  for both modeling approaches. A model which includes the observed flattening gives a 47% larger mass (see Chatzopoulos et al.). Our results slightly favor a core over a cusp in the mass profile. By minimizing the number of unbound stars within 8", we obtain a distance of {R}0={8.53}-0.15+0.21 kpc when using an R0 supermassive black hole mass relation from stellar orbits. Combining our results, we obtain M/L=0.51+/- 0.12{M}&sun; /{L}&sun; ,{Ks}, which is roughly consistent with a Chabrier IMF.

@article{Lockmann:2010qy,
	Abstract = {For half a century, evidence has been growing that the formation of stars follows a universal distribution of stellar masses. In fact, no stellar population has been found showing a systematic deviation from the canonical initial mass function (IMF) found for example for the stars in the solar neighbourhood. The only exception may be the young stellar discs in the Galactic Centre, which have been argued to exhibit a top-heavy IMF.  Here we discuss the question whether the extreme circumstances in the centre of the Milky Way may be the reason for a significant variation of the IMF. By means of stellar evolution models using different codes, we show that the observed luminosity in the central parsec is too high to be explained by a long-standing top-heavy IMF as suggested by other authors, considering the limited amount of mass inferred from stellar kinematics in this region. In contrast, continuous star formation over the Galaxy's lifetime following a canonical IMF results in a mass-to-light ratio and a total mass of stellar black holes (SBHs) consistent with the observations. Furthermore, these SBHs migrate towards the centre due to dynamical friction, turning the cusp of visible stars into a core as observed in the Galactic Centre. For the first time here we explain the luminosity and dynamical mass of the central cluster and both the presence and extent of the observed core, since the number of SBHs expected from a canonical IMF is just enough to make up for the missing luminous mass.  We conclude that observations of the Galactic Centre are well consistent with continuous star formation following the canonical IMF and do not suggest a systematic variation as a result of the region's properties such as high density, metallicity, strong tidal field etc. If the young stellar discs prove to follow a top-heavy IMF, the circumstances that led to their formation must be very rare, since these have not affected most of the central cluster.},

	Abstract = {The Milky Way and a significant fraction of galaxies are observed to host a central massive black hole (MBH) embedded in a non-spherical nuclear star cluster. We study the secular orbital evolution of compact-object binaries in these environments and characterize the excitation of extremely large eccentricities that can lead to mergers by gravitational radiation. We find that the eccentricity excitation occurs most efficiently when the nodal precession timescale of the binary's orbit around the MBH due to the non-spherical cluster becomes comparable (within a factor of ˜10) to the timescale on which the binary is torqued by the MBH due to the Lidov-Kozai (LK) mechanism. We show that in this regime the perturbations due to the cluster increase the fraction of systems that reach extreme eccentricities (1{--}e˜ {10}-4{--}{10}-6) by a factor of ˜10-100 compared to the idealized case of a spherical cluster, increasing the merger rates of compact objects by a similar factor. We identify two main channels that lead to this extreme eccentricity excitation: (I) chaotic diffusion of the eccentricities due to resonance overlap; (II) cluster-driven variations of the mutual inclinations between the binary orbit and its center-of-mass orbit around the MBH, which can intensify the LK oscillations. We estimate that our mechanism can produce BH-BH and BH-neutron star binary merger rates of up to ≈ 15 {{Gpc}}-3 {{yr}}-1 and ≈ 0.4 {{Gpc}}-3 {{yr}}-1, respectively. Thus, we propose the cluster-enhanced LK mechanism as a new channel for the merger of compact-object binaries, competing with scenarios that invoke isolated binary evolution or dynamical formation in globular clusters.},

@article{Hoang:2018lr,
	Abstract = {Nuclear star clusters around a central massive black hole (MBH) are expected to be abundant in stellar black hole (BH) remnants and BH-BH binaries. These binaries form a hierarchical triple system with the central MBH, and gravitational perturbations from the MBH can cause high-eccentricity excitation in the BH-BH binary orbit. During this process, the eccentricity may approach unity, and the pericenter distance may become sufficiently small so that gravitational-wave emission drives the BH-BH binary to merge. In this work, we construct a simple proof-of-concept model for this process, and specifically, we study the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism in unequal-mass, soft BH-BH binaries. Our model is based on a set of Monte Carlo simulations for BH-BH binaries in galactic nuclei, taking into account quadrupole- and octupole-level secular perturbations, general relativistic precession, and gravitational-wave emission. For a typical steady-state number of BH-BH binaries, our model predicts a total merger rate of ˜1-3  {Gpc} -3 {yr} -1, depending on the assumed density profile in the nucleus. Thus, our mechanism could potentially compete with other dynamical formation processes for merging BH-BH binaries, such as the interactions of stellar BHs in globular clusters or in nuclear star clusters without an MBH.},

	Abstract = {We present improved relative astrometry for stars within the central half parsec of our Galactic Center (GC) based on data obtained with the 10 m W. M. Keck Observatory from 1995 to 2017. The new methods used to improve the astrometric precision and accuracy include correcting for local astrometric distortions, applying a magnitude-dependent additive error, and more carefully removing instances of stellar confusion. Additionally, we adopt jackknife methods to calculate velocity and acceleration uncertainties. The resulting median proper motion uncertainty is 0.05 mas yr-1 for our complete sample of 1184 stars in the central 10" (0.4 pc). We have detected 24 accelerating sources, 2.6 times more than the number of previously published accelerating sources, which extend out to 4" (0.16 pc) from the black hole. Based on S0-2's orbit, our new astrometric analysis has reduced the systematic error of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) by a factor of 2. The linear drift in our astrometric reference frame is also reduced in the north--south direction by a factor of 4. We also find the first potential astrometric binary candidate S0-27 in the GC. These astrometric improvements provide a foundation for future studies of the origin and dynamics of the young stars around the SMBH, the structure and dynamics of the old nuclear star cluster, the SMBH's properties derived from orbits, and tests of general relativity in a strong gravitational field.},

	Abstract = {During their dynamical evolution, Galactic open clusters (OCs) gradually lose their stellar content mainly because of internal relaxation and tidal forces. In this context, the study of dynamically evolved OCs is necessary to properly understand such processes. We present a comprehensive Washington CT1 photometric analysis of six sparse OCs, namely ESO 518-3, Ruprecht 121, ESO 134-12, NGC 6573, ESO 260-7, and ESO 065-7. We employed Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to robustly determine the central coordinates and the structural parameters and T1 × (C - T1) colour-magnitude diagrams cleaned from field contamination were used to derive the fundamental parameters. ESO 518-03, Ruprecht 121, ESO 134-12, and NGC 6573 resulted to be of nearly the same young age [8.2 <=log(t yr-1) <= 8.3]; ESO 260-7 and ESO065-7 are of intermediate age [9.2 <=log(t yr-1) <= 9.4]. All studied OCs are located at similar Galactocentric distances (RG ˜6-6.9 kpc), considering uncertainties, except for ESO 260-7 (RG = 8.9 kpc). These OCs are in a tidally filled regime and are dynamically evolved, since they are much older than their half-mass relaxation times (t/trh ≳ 30) and present signals of low-mass star depletion. We distinguished two groups: those dynamically evolving towards final disruptions and those in an advanced dynamical evolutionary stage. Although we do not rule out that the Milky Way potential could have made differentially faster their dynamical evolutions, we speculate here with the possibility that they have been mainly driven by initial formation conditions.},

	Abstract = {We have carried out a survey of compact star clusters (apparent size lsim3'') in the southwest part of the M31 galaxy, based on the high-resolution Suprime-Cam images (17farcm5 × 28farcm5), covering ~15% of the deprojected galaxy disk area. The UBVRI photometry of 285 cluster candidates (V lsim 20.5 mag) was performed using frames of the Local Group Galaxies Survey. The final sample, containing 238 high probability star cluster candidates (typical half-light radius rh ~ 1.5 pc), was selected by specifying a lower limit of rh gsim 0farcs15 (gsim0.6 pc). We derived cluster parameters based on the photometric data and multiband images by employing simple stellar population models. The clusters have a wide range of ages from ~5 Myr (young objects associated with 24 mum and/or Halpha emission) to ~10 Gyr (globular cluster candidates), and possess mass in a range of 3.0 lsim log(m/m sun) lsim 4.3 peaking at m ~ 4000 m sun. Typical age of these intermediate-mass clusters is in the range of 30 Myr lsim t lsim 3 Gyr, with a prominent peak at ~70 Myr. These findings suggest a rich intermediate-mass star cluster population in M31, which appears to be scarce in the Milky Way galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a 6.4 square degrees imaging survey of the Pleiades cluster in the I and Z-bands. The survey extends up to 3 degrees from the cluster center and is 90% complete down to I =~  22. It covers a mass range from 0.03 Msun to 0.48 Msun and yields 40 brown dwarf candidates (BDCs) of which 29 are new. The spatial distribution of BDCs is fitted by a King profile in order to estimate the cluster substellar core radius. The Pleiades mass function is then derived accross the stellar-substellar boundary and we find that, between 0.03 Msun and 0.48 Msun, it is well represented by a single power-law, dN/dM~ M-alpha , with an index alpha =0.60+/- 0.11. Over a larger mass domain, however, from 0.03 Msun to 10 Msun, the mass function is better fitted by a log-normal function. We estimate that brown dwarfs represent about 25% of the cluster population which nevertheless makes up less than 1.5% of the cluster mass. The early dynamical evolution of the cluster appears to have had little effect on its present mass distribution at an age of 120 Myr. Comparison between the Pleiades mass function and the Galactic field mass function suggests that apparent differences may be mostly due to unresolved binary systems.

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic study of candidate brown dwarf members of the Orion Nebula cluster (ONC). We obtained new J- and/or K-band spectra of ~100 objects within the ONC that are expected to be substellar on the basis of their K magnitudes and H-K colors. Spectral classification in the near-infrared of young low-mass objects is described, including the effects of surface gravity, veiling due to circumstellar material, and reddening. From our derived spectral types and existing near-infrared photometry, we construct an H-R diagram for the cluster. Masses are inferred for each object and used to derive the brown dwarf fraction and assess the mass function for the inner 5.1 arcmin 1×5.1 arcmin of the ONC, down to ~0.02 Msolar. The logarithmic mass function rises to a peak at ~0.2 Msolar, similar to previous initial mass function determinations derived from purely photometric methods but falls off more sharply at the hydrogen-burning limit before leveling through the substellar regime. We compare the mass function derived here for the inner ONC with those presented in recent literature for the sparsely populated Taurus cloud members and the rich cluster IC 348. We find good agreement between the shapes and peak values of the ONC and IC 348 mass distributions but little similarity between the ONC and Taurus results.},

	Abstract = {We report the result of a study in which we have used very deep broadband V and I Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images of the R136 cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud from the Hubble Space Telescope archive to sample the luminosity function below the detection limit of 2.8 Msolar previously reached. In these new deeper images, we detect stars down to a limiting magnitude of mF555W=24.7 (~=1 mag deeper than previous works) and identify a population of red stars evenly distributed in the surrounding of the R136 cluster. A comparison of our color-magnitude diagram with recently computed evolutionary tracks indicates that these red objects are pre-main-sequence stars in the mass range 0.6-3 Msolar. We construct the initial mass function (IMF) in the 1.35-6.5 Msolar range and find that, after correcting for incompleteness, the IMF shows a definite flattening below ~=2 Msolar. We discuss the implications of this result for the R136 cluster and for our understanding of starburst galaxy formation and evolution in general. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA for NASA under contract NAS 5-26555, and observations obtained at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive catalog of 700 confirmed star clusters in the field of M31 compiled from three major existing catalogs. We detect 418 and 257 star clusters in Galaxy Evolution Explorer near-ultraviolet and far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging, respectively. Our final catalog includes photometry of star clusters in up to 16 passbands ranging from FUV to NIR as well as ancillary information such as reddening, metallicity, and radial velocities. In particular, this is the most extensive and updated catalog of UV-integrated photometry for M31 star clusters. Ages and masses of star clusters are derived by fitting the multi-band photometry with model spectral energy distribution (SED); UV photometry enables more accurate age estimation of young clusters. Our catalog includes 182 young clusters with ages less than 1 Gyr. Our estimated ages and masses of young clusters are in good agreement with previously determined values in the literature. The mean age and mass of young clusters are about 300 Myr and 104 M &sun;, respectively. We found that the compiled [Fe/H] values of young clusters included in our catalog are systematically lower (by more than 1 dex) than those from recent high-quality spectroscopic data and our SED-fitting result. We confirm that most of the young clusters' kinematics shows systematic rotation around the minor axis and association with the thin disk of M31. The young cluster distribution exhibits a distinct peak in the M31 disk around 10-12 kpc from the center and follows a spatial distributions similar to other tracers of disk structure such as OB stars, UV star-forming regions, and dust. Some young clusters also show concentration around the ring splitting regions found in the southern part of the M31 disk and most of them have systematically younger (<100 Myr) ages. Considering the kinematical properties and spatial distribution of young clusters, they might be associated with the well-known 10 kpc star formation ring structure in the M31 disk. Consequently, we suggest that various properties of young clusters in M31 might be in line with the scenarios that a satellite galaxy had passed through the disk of M31 less than few hundred million years ago.},

	Abstract = {We summarize work on the central parsec of the Galactic center based on imaging and spectroscopic observations at the Keck and Gemini telescopes. These observations include stellar positions in two dimension and the velocity in three dimensions. Spectroscopic observations also enables measurements of the physical properties of individual stars, such as the spectral type and in some cases the effective temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity. These observations show a complex stellar population with a young (4-6 Myr) compact star cluster in the central 0.5 pc embedded in in an older and much more massive nuclear star cluster. Surprisingly, the old late-type giants do not show a cusp profile as long been expected from theoretical work. The majority of the stars have higher than solar metallicity, with only about 6% of the stars having [M/Fe] < -0.5, which is consistent with an origin from the MW disk.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained optical and near-infrared spectra of candidate members of the star-forming clusters IC 348 and NGC 1333. We classify 100 and 42 candidates as new members of the clusters, respectively, which brings the total numbers of known members to 478 and 203. We also have performed spectroscopy on a large majority of the previously known members of NGC 1333 in order to provide spectral classifications that are measured with the same scheme that has been applied to IC 348 in previous studies. The new census of members is nearly complete for K  s  < 16.8 at A  J  < 1.5 in IC 348 and for K  s  < 16.2 at A  J  < 3 in NGC 1333, which correspond to masses of ≳0.01 M &sun; for ages of 3 Myr according to theoretical evolutionary models. The faintest known members extend below these completeness limits and appear to have masses of ˜0.005 M &sun;. In extinction-limited samples of cluster members, NGC 1333 exhibits a higher abundance of objects at lower masses than IC 348. It would be surprising if the initial mass functions of these clusters differ significantly given their similar stellar densities and formation environments. Instead, it is possible that average extinctions are lower for less massive members of star-forming clusters, in which case extinction-limited samples could be biased in favor of low-mass objects in the more heavily embedded clusters like NGC 1333. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the median sequences of IC 348 and NGC 1333 coincide with each other for the adopted distances of 300 and 235 pc, which would suggest that they have similar ages. However, NGC 1333 is widely believed to be younger than IC 348 based on its higher abundance of disks and protostars and its greater obscuration. Errors in the adopted distances may be responsible for this discrepancy.  Based on data from the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, Gemini Observatory, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, Keck Observatory, Subaru Telescope, the Digitized Sky Survey, and the Two Micron All-Sky Survey.},

	Abstract = {We present spectroscopy of candidate stellar and substellar members of the young cluster IC 348. Using the Florida Multi-Object Imaging Near-Infrared Grism Observational Spectrometer with the 4 m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, we have obtained multiobject moderate-resolution (R=1000) J- and H-band spectra of 66 infrared sources (H=12-17) toward IC 348, many of which are difficult to observe spectroscopically at optical wavelengths (I>20) because they are highly reddened and/or intrinsically cool and red. We have also observed 19 known cluster members that have optical spectral types available from previous work. By using these latter sources as the spectral classification standards, we have identified 14 new members of the cluster with types M2-M6 in the sample of 66 new objects. Two additional objects exhibit types later than M8.5 but cannot be conclusively classified as either field dwarfs or cluster members with available data. We have estimated extinctions, luminosities, and effective temperatures for these 16 M-type objects, placed them on the H-R diagram, and used the evolutionary models of Chabrier & Baraffe to estimate their masses. If the two candidates at later than M8.5 are indeed members, they should be among the least massive known brown dwarfs in IC 348 (M/Msolar~0.01).},

	Abstract = {The Arches is one of the youngest, densest and most massive clusters in the Galaxy. As such it provides a unique insight into the lifecycle of the most massive stars known and the formation and survival of such stellar aggregates in the extreme conditions of the Galactic Centre. In a previous study we presented an initial stellar census for the Arches and in this work we expand upon this, providing new and revised classifications for ~30% of the 105 spectroscopically identified cluster members as well as distinguishing potential massive runaways. The results of this survey emphasise the homogeneity and apparent co-evality of the Arches and confirm the absence of H-free Wolf-Rayets of WC sub-type and predicted luminosities. The increased depth of our complete dataset also provides significantly better constraints on the main sequence population; with the identification of O9.5 V stars for the first time we now spectroscopically sample stars with initial masses ranging from ~16Msun to >120Msun. Indeed, following from our expanded stellar census we might expect >50 stars within the Arches to have been born with masses >60Msun, while all 105 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members are massive enough to leave relativistic remnants upon their demise. Moreover the well defined observational properties of the main sequence cohort will be critical to the construction of an extinction law appropriate for the Galactic Centre and consequently the quantitative analysis of the Arches population and subsequent determination of the cluster initial mass function.},

	Abstract = {We derive an analytical theory of the prestellar core initial mass function (IMF) based on an extension of the Press-Schechter statistical formalism. Our approach relies on the general concept of the gravothermal and gravoturbulent collapse of a molecular cloud, with a selection criterion based on the thermal or turbulent Jeans mass, which yields the derivation of the mass spectrum of self-gravitating objects in a quiescent or a turbulent environment. The same formalism also yields the mass spectrum of non-self-gravitating clumps produced in supersonic flows. The mass spectrum of the self-gravitating cores reproduces well the observed IMF. The theory predicts that the shape of the IMF results from two competing contributions, namely, a power law at large scales and an exponential cutoff (lognormal form) centered around the characteristic mass for gravitational collapse. The cutoff exists both in the case of thermal or turbulent collapse, provided that the underlying density field has a lognormal distribution. Whereas pure thermal collapse produces a power-law tail steeper than the Salpeter value, dN/dlog M propto M-x with x simeq 1.35, the latter is recovered exactly for the (three-dimensional) value of the spectral index of the velocity power spectrum, n simeq 3.8, found in observations and in numerical simulations of isothermal supersonic turbulence. Indeed, the theory predicts that x = (n + 1)/(2n - 4) for self-gravitating structures and x = 2 - n'/3 for non-self-gravitating structures, where n' is the power spectrum index of log rho . We show that, whereas supersonic turbulence promotes the formation of both massive stars and brown dwarfs, it has an overall negative impact on star formation, decreasing the star formation efficiency. This theory provides a novel theoretical foundation to understand the origin of the IMF and provides useful guidance to numerical simulations exploring star formation, while making testable predictions.},

	Abstract = {We construct a stellar cluster catalog for the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey using image classifications collected from the Andromeda Project citizen science website. We identify 2753 clusters and 2270 background galaxies within ˜0.5 deg2 of PHAT imaging searched, or ˜400 kpc2 in deprojected area at the distance of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). These identifications result from 1.82 million classifications of ˜20,000 individual images (totaling ˜7 gigapixels) by tens of thousands of volunteers. We show that our crowd-sourced approach, which collects >80 classifications per image, provides a robust, repeatable method of cluster identification. The high spatial resolution Hubble Space Telescope images resolve individual stars in each cluster and are instrumental in the factor of ˜6 increase in the number of clusters known within the survey footprint. We measure integrated photometry in six filter passbands, ranging from the near-UV to the near-IR. PHAT clusters span a range of ˜8 magnitudes in F475W (g-band) luminosity, equivalent to ˜4 decades in cluster mass. We perform catalog completeness analysis using >3000 synthetic cluster simulations to determine robust detection limits and demonstrate that the catalog is 50% complete down to ˜500 {{M}&sun; } for ages <100 Myr. We include catalogs of clusters, background galaxies, remaining unselected candidates, and synthetic cluster simulations, making all information publicly available to the community. The catalog published here serves as the definitive base data product for PHAT cluster science, providing a census of star clusters in an {{L}\star } spiral galaxy with unmatched sensitivity and quality.},

	Abstract = {We have compiled a significantly updated and comprehensive census of massive stars in the nearby Cygnus OB2 association by gathering and homogenizing data from across the literature. The census contains 169 primary OB stars, including 52 O-type stars and 3 Wolf-Rayet stars. Spectral types and photometry are used to place the stars in a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which is compared to both non-rotating and rotating stellar evolution models, from which stellar masses and ages are calculated. The star formation history and mass function of the association are assessed, and both are found to be heavily influenced by the evolution of the most massive stars to their end states. We find that the mass function of the most massive stars is consistent with a `universal' power-law slope of Gamma = 1.3. The age distribution inferred from stellar evolutionary models with rotation and the mass function suggest the majority of star formation occurred more or less continuously between 1 and 7 Myr ago, in agreement with studies of low- and intermediate-mass stars in the association. We identify a nearby young pulsar and runaway O-type star that may have originated in Cyg OB2 and suggest that the association has already seen its first supernova. Finally we use the census and mass function to calculate the total mass of the association of 16 500^{+3800}_{-2800} M&sun;, at the low end, but consistent with, previous estimates of the total mass of Cyg OB2. Despite this Cyg OB2 is still one of the most massive groups of young stars known in our Galaxy making it a prime target for studies of star formation on the largest scales.},

	Abstract = {We present a high-precision proper motion study of 873 X-ray and spectroscopically selected stars in the massive OB association Cygnus OB2 as part of the DANCe project. These were calculated from images spanning a 15 yr baseline and have typical precisions <1 mas yr-1. We calculate the velocity dispersion in the two axes to be sigma _alpha (c) = 13.0^{+0.8}_{-0.7} and sigma _delta (c) = 9.1^{+0.5}_{-0.5} km s-1, using a two-component, two-dimensional model that takes into account the uncertainties on the measurements. This gives a three-dimensional velocity dispersion of sigma3D = 17.8 $\pm$ 0.6 km s-1 implying a virial mass significantly larger than the observed stellar mass, confirming that the association is gravitationally unbound. The association appears to be dynamically unevolved, as evidenced by considerable kinematic substructure, non-isotropic velocity dispersions and a lack of energy equipartition. The proper motions show no evidence for a global expansion pattern, with approximately the same amount of kinetic energy in expansion as there is in contraction, which argues against the association being an expanded star cluster disrupted by process such as residual gas expulsion or tidal heating. The kinematic substructures, which appear to be close to virial equilibrium and have typical masses of 40-400 M&sun;, also do not appear to have been affected by the expulsion of the residual gas. We conclude that Cyg OB2 was most likely born highly substructured and globally unbound, with the individual subgroups born in (or close to) virial equilibrium, and that the OB association has not experienced significant dynamical evolution since then.},

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic study of the most massive stars in the young (4 Myr old) stellar cluster LH 95 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This analysis allows us to complete the census of the stellar population of the system, previously investigated by us down to 0.4 M&sun; with deep Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys photometry. We perform spectral classification of the five stars in our sample, based on high-resolution optical spectroscopy obtained with the 2.2-m MPG/ESO Fibre-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph. We use complementary ground-based photometry, previously performed by us, to place these stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We derive their masses and ages by interpolation from evolutionary models. The average ages and age spread of the most massive stars are found to be in general comparable with those previously derived for the cluster from its low-mass pre-main-sequence stars. We use the masses of the five sample stars to extend to the high-mass end the stellar initial mass function of LH 95 previously established by us. We find that the initial mass function follows a Salpeter relation down to the intermediate-mass regime at 2 M&sun;. The second most massive star in LH 95 shows broad Balmer line emission and infrared excess, which are compatible with a classical Be star. The existence of such a star in the system adds a constrain to the age of the cluster, which is well covered by our age and age spread determinations. The most massive star, a 60-70 M&sun; O2 giant, is found to be younger (<1 Myr) than the rest of the population. Its mass in relation to the total mass of the system does not follow the empirical relation of the maximum stellar mass versus the hosting cluster mass, making LH 95 an exception to the average trend.},

	Abstract = {Some theories of star formation suggest massive stars may only form in clustered environments, which would create a deficit of massive stars in low-density environments. Observationally, Massey finds such a deficit in samples of the field population in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, with an initial mass function (IMF) slope of GammaIMF ~ 4. These IMF measurements represent some of the largest known deviations from the standard Salpeter IMF slope of GammaIMF = 1.35. Here, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the mass function above 20 M &sun; for the entire field population of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), based on data from the Runaways and Isolated O Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4). This is a spatially complete census of the entire field OB star population of the SMC obtained with the IMACS multi-object spectrograph and MIKE echelle spectrograph on the Magellan telescopes. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of the evolved present-day mass function, we find the slope of the field IMF above 20 M &sun; is GammaIMF = 2.3 $\pm$ 0.4. We extend our IMF measurement to lower masses using BV photometry from the OGLE II survey. We use a statistical approach to generate a probability distribution for the mass of each star from the OGLE photometry, and we again find GammaIMF = 2.3 $\pm$ 0.6 for stellar masses from 7 M &sun; to 20 M &sun;. The discovery and removal of ten runaways in our RIOTS4 sample steepens the field IMF slope to GammaIMF = 2.8 $\pm$ 0.5. We discuss the possible effects of binarity and star formation history on our results, and conclude that the steep field massive star IMF is most likely a real effect.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

We constrain the upper-end initial mass function (IMF) and determine the star formation law (SFL) in this field, using the observed main-sequence stars and an assumed constant star formation rate. Previously published Halpha observations of the field, which show one faint H II region, are used to provide further constraints on the IMF. We find that the main-sequence luminosity function analysis alone results in a best-fitting IMF with a power-law slope alpha = -2.85 and upper-mass limit M_u = 60 M_{&sun;}. However, if we assume that all Halpha emission is confined to H II regions then the upper-mass limit is restricted to M_u ≲ 20 M_{&sun;}. For the luminosity function fit to be correct, we have to discount the Halpha observations implying significant diffuse ionized gas or escaping ionizing photons. Combining the HST photometry with H I imaging, we find the SFL has a power-law index N = 1.53 $\pm$ 0.21. Applying these results to the entire outer H I disc indicates that it contributes 11-28 per cent of the total recent star formation in NGC 2915, depending on whether the IMF is constant within the disc or varies from the centre to the outer region.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a detailed UV-optical study of the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 4214 using multifilter Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 and STIS photometry. The stellar extinction is found to be quite patchy, with some areas having values of E(4405-5495)<0.1 mag and others, associated with star-forming regions, much more heavily obscured, a result that is consistent with previous studies of the nebular extinction. We determined the ratio of blue to red supergiants and found it to be consistent with theoretical models for the metallicity of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the field in the range 20-100 Msolar is found to be steeper than gamma=-2.8 (gamma=-2.35 for a Salpeter IMF). A number of massive clusters and associations with ages between a few and 200 Myr are detected, and their properties are discussed.

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the near-infrared spectrum of a young massive star cluster in the overlap region of the interacting galaxies NGC 4038/39 using population synthesis models. Our goal is to model the cluster population as well as provide rough constraints on its initial mass function (IMF). The cluster shows signs of youth, such as thermal radio emission and strong hydrogen emission lines in the near-infrared. Late-type absorption lines are also present which are indicative of late-type stars in the cluster. The strength and ratio of these absorption lines cannot be reproduced through either late-type pre-main sequence (PMS) stars or red supergiants alone. Thus, we interpret the spectrum as a superposition of two star clusters of different ages, which is feasible since the 1'' spectrum encompasses a physical region of ≈90 pc and radii of super-star clusters (SSCs) are generally measured to be a few parsecs. One cluster is young (<= 3 Myr) and is responsible for part of the late-type absorption features, which are due to PMS stars in the cluster, and the hydrogen emission lines. The second cluster is older (6 Myr-18 Myr) and is needed to reproduce the overall depth of the late-type absorption features in the spectrum. Both are required to accurately reproduce the near-infrared spectrum of the object. Thus, we have directly detected PMS objects in an unresolved SSC for the first time using a combination of population synthesis models and PMS tracks. This analysis serves as a testbed of our technique to constrain the low-mass IMF in young SSCs as well as an exploration of the star formation history of young UC H II regions.},

	Abstract = {We have used multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 data of the starbursting spiral galaxy M83 in order to measure variations in the upper end of the stellar initial mass function (uIMF) using the production rate of ionizing photons in unresolved clusters with ages <= 8 Myr. As in earlier papers on M51 and NGC 4214, the uIMF in M83 is consistent with a universal IMF, and stochastic sampling of the stellar populations in the lap103 M &sun; clusters are responsible for any deviations in this universality. The ensemble cluster population, as well as individual clusters, also imply that the most massive star in a cluster does not depend on the cluster mass. In fact, we have found that these small clusters seem to have an over-abundance of ionizing photons when compared to an expected universal or truncated IMF. This also suggests that the presence of massive stars in these clusters does not affect the star formation in a destructive way.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) stellar census of R136a, the central ionizing star cluster of 30 Doradus. We present low resolution far-ultraviolet STIS spectroscopy of R136 using 17 contiguous 52 arcsec × 0.2 arcsec slits which together provide complete coverage of the central 0.85 parsec (3.4 arcsec). We provide spectral types of 90 per cent of the 57 sources brighter than mF555W = 16.0 mag within a radius of 0.5 parsec of R136a1, plus 8 additional nearby sources including R136b (O4 If/WN8). We measure wind velocities for 52 early-type stars from C IVlambdalambda1548-51, including 16 O2-3 stars. For the first time, we spectroscopically classify all Weigelt and Baier members of R136a, which comprise three WN5 stars (a1-a3), two O supergiants (a5-a6) and three early O dwarfs (a4, a7, a8). A complete Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the most massive O stars in R136 is provided, from which we obtain a cluster age of 1.5^{+0.3}_{-0.7} Myr. In addition, we discuss the integrated ultraviolet spectrum of R136, and highlight the central role played by the most luminous stars in producing the prominent He II lambda1640 emission line. This emission is totally dominated by very massive stars with initial masses above ˜100 M&sun;. The presence of strong He II lambda1640 emission in the integrated light of very young star clusters (e.g. A1 in NGC 3125) favours an initial mass function extending well beyond a conventional upper limit of 100 M&sun;. We include montages of ultraviolet spectroscopy for Large Magellanic Cloud O stars in the appendix. Future studies in this series will focus on optical STIS medium resolution observations.},

	Abstract = {Deep Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys photometry of the young cluster NGC 602, located in the remote low-density "wing" of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), reveals numerous pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars as well as young stars on the main sequence. The resolved stellar content thus provides a basis for studying the star formation history (SFH) into recent times and constraining several stellar population properties, such as the present-day mass function (PDMF), the initial mass function, and the binary fraction. To better characterize the PMS population, we present a new set of model stellar evolutionary tracks for this evolutionary phase with metallicity appropriate for the SMC (Z = 0.004). We use a stellar population synthesis code, which takes into account a full range of stellar evolution phases to derive our best estimate for the SFH in the region by comparing observed and synthetic color-magnitude diagrams. The derived PDMF for NGC 602 is consistent with that resulting from the synthetic diagrams. The star formation rate in the region has increased with time on a scale of tens of Myr, reaching (0.3-0.7) × 10-3 M sun yr-1 in the last 2.5 Myr, comparable to what is found in Galactic OB associations. Star formation is most complete in the main cluster but continues at moderate levels in the gas-rich periphery of the nebula.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.

	Abstract = {We present our photometric study of the stellar association NGC 602 in the wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The data were taken in the filters F555W and F814W using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Photometry was performed using the ACS module of the stellar photometry package DOLPHOT. We detected more than 5500 stars with a magnitude range of 14lesssim m555lesssim 28 mag. Three prominent stellar concentrations are identified with star counts in the observed field, the association NGC 602 itself, and two clusters, one of them not being currently in any known catalog. The color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of both clusters show features typical for young open clusters, while that of the association reveals bright main-sequence (MS) and faint pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars as the members of the system. We construct the initial mass spectrum (IMS) of the association by applying an age-independent method of counting the PMS stars within evolutionary tracks, while for the bright MS stars we transform their magnitudes to masses with the use of mass-luminosity relations. The IMS of NGC 602 is found to be well represented by a single power law, corresponding to an initial mass function (IMF) of slope Gamma ≈ - 1.2 for 1 lesssim M/M&sun; lesssim 45. This indicates that the shape of the IMF of a star-forming system in the SMC for stars with masses higher than 1 M&sun; seems to be quite similar to the field IMF in the solar neighborhood.

	Abstract = {A new X-ray, UBVRIc, and JHKs study of the young cluster Westerlund 2 was undertaken to resolve discrepancies tied to the cluster's distance. Existing spectroscopic observations for bright cluster members and new multi-band photometry imply a reddening relation toward Westerlund 2 described by EU - B/EB - V = 0.63 + 0.02EB - V. Variable-extinction analyses for Westerlund 2 and nearby IC 2581 based upon spectroscopic distance moduli and ZAMS fitting yield values of RV = AV/EB - V = 3.88 $\pm$ 0.18 and 3.77 $\pm$ 0.19, respectively, and confirm prior assertions that anomalous interstellar extinction is widespread throughout Carina. The results were confirmed by applying the color-difference method to UBVRIcJHKs data for 19 spectroscopically observed cluster members, yielding RV = 3.85 $\pm$ 0.07. The derived distance to Westerlund 2 of d = 2.85 $\pm$ 0.43 kpc places the cluster on the far side of the Carina spiral arm. The cluster's age is no more than tau ~ 2 × 106 yr as inferred from the cluster's brightest stars and an X-ray (Chandra) cleaned analysis of its pre-main-sequence demographic. Four Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core and surrounding corona (WR20a, WR20b, WR20c, and WR20aa) are very likely cluster members, and their inferred luminosities are consistent with those of other late-WN stars in open clusters. The color-magnitude diagram for Westerlund 2 also displays a gap at spectral type B0.5 V with associated color spread at higher and lower absolute magnitudes that might be linked to close binary mergers. These features, in conjunction with the evidence for mass loss from the WR stars, may help to explain the high flux of gamma-rays, cosmic rays, and X-rays from the direction toward Westerlund 2.  Based on observations carried out at Las Campanas Observatory.Full photometric data are available at the CDS via anomymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/555/A50},

	Abstract = {The connection between the pre-stellar core mass function (CMF) and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) lies at the heart of all star formation theories. In this paper, we study the earliest phases of star formation with a series of high-resolution numerical simulations that include the formation of sinks. In particular, we focus on the transition from cores to sinks within a massive molecular filament. We compare the CMF and IMF between magnetized and unmagnetized simulations, and between different resolutions. We find that selecting cores based on their kinematic virial parameter excludes collapsing objects because they host large velocity dispersions. Selecting only the thermally unstable magnetized cores, we observe that their mass-to-flux ratio spans almost two orders of magnitude for a given mass. We also see that, when magnetic fields are included, the CMF peaks at higher core mass values with respect to pure hydrodynamical simulations. Nonetheless, all models produce sink mass functions with a high-mass slope consistent with Salpeter. Finally, we examine the effects of resolution and find that, in isothermal simulations, even models with very high dynamical range fail to converge in the mass function. Our main conclusion is that, although the resulting CMFs and IMFs have similar slopes in all simulations, the cores have slightly different sizes and kinematical properties when a magnetic field is included. However, a core selection based on the mass-to-flux ratio alone is not enough to alter the shape of the CMF, if we do not take thermal stability into account. Finally, we conclude that extreme care should be given to resolution issues when studying sink formation with an isothermal equation of state.},

	Abstract = {Almost all young stars are found in multiple systems. This suggests that protostellar cores almost always fragment into multiple objects. The observed properties of multiple systems such as their separation distribution and mass ratios provide strong constraints on star-formation theories. We review the observed properties of young and old multiple systems and find that the multiplicity of stars changes. Such an evolution is probably due to (a) the dynamical decay of small-N systems and/or (b) the destruction of multiple systems within dense clusters. We review simulations of the fragmentation of rotating and turbulent molecular cores. Such models almost always produce multiple systems; however, the properties of those systems do not match observations at all well. Magnetic fields appear to supress fragmentation, perhaps suggesting that they are not dynamically important in the formation of multiple systems. We finish by discussing possible reasons why theory fails to match observation, and the future prospects for this field.},

	Abstract = {We examine whether massive-star accretion discs are likely to fragment due to self-gravity. Rapid accretion and high angular momentum push these discs toward fragmentation, whereas viscous heating and the high protostellar luminosity stabilize them. We find that for a broad range of protostar masses and for reasonable accretion times, massive discs larger than ~150au are prone to fragmentation. We develop an analytical estimate for the angular momentum of accreted material, extending the analysis of Matzner & Levin to account for strongly turbulent initial conditions. In a core-collapse model, we predict that discs are marginally prone to fragmentation around stars of about 4-15Msolar - even if we adopt conservative estimates of the discs' radii and tendency to fragment. More massive stars are progressively more likely to fragment, and there is a sharp drop in the stability of disc accretion at the very high accretion rates expected above 110Msolar. Fragmentation may starve accretion in massive stars, especially above this limit, and is likely to create swarms of small, coplanar companions.},

	Abstract = {Stellar multiplicity is a ubiquitous outcome of the star-formation process. The frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems, and their dependence on primary mass and environment, are powerful tools to probe this process. Although early attempts were fraught with selection biases and limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the past two decades now enable robust statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for main sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of pre-main-sequence stars and embedded protostars. Among field objects, the multiplicity rate and breadth of the orbital period distribution are steep functions of the primary mass, whereas the mass ratio distribution is essentially flat for most populations other than the lowest mass objects. The time-variation of the frequency of visual companions follows two parallel, constant tracks corresponding to loose and dense stellar populations, although current observations do not yet distinguish whether initial multiplicity properties are universal or dependent on the physical conditions of the parent cloud. Nonetheless, these quantitative trends provide a rich comparison basis for numerical and analytical models of star formation.},

Previous observations showed a relative paucity of red giant stars within the central 0.5 pc in the Galactic Center. By co-adding spectroscopic observations taken over a decade, we identify new late-type stars, including the first five warm giants (G2-G8III), within the central 1 arcsec2 (0.04 × 0.04 pc2) of the Galaxy. Our findings increase the number of late-type stars to 21, of which we present deep spectra for 16. The updated star count, based on individual spectral classification, is used to reconstruct the surface density profile of giant stars. Our study, for the first time, finds a cusp in the surface number density of the spectroscopically identified old (>3 Gyr) giants population (m  K  < 17) within 0.02--0.4 pc described by a single power law with an exponent Gamma = 0.34 $\pm$ 0.04.},

	Abstract = {Populations of massive stars are directly reflective of the physics of stellar evolution. Counts of subtypes of massive stars and ratios of massive stars in different evolutionary states have been used ubiquitously as diagnostics of age and metallicity effects. While the binary fraction of massive stars is significant, inferences are often based upon models incorporating only single-star evolution. In this work, we utilize custom synthetic stellar populations from the Binary Population and Stellar Synthesis code to determine the effect of stellar binaries on number count ratios of different evolutionary stages in both young massive clusters and galaxies with massive stellar populations. We find that many ratios are degenerate in metallicity, age, and/or binary fraction. We develop diagnostic plots using these stellar count ratios to help break this degeneracy, and use these plots to compare our predictions to observed data in the Milky Way and the Local Group. These data suggest a possible correlation between the massive star binary fraction and metallicity. We also examine the robustness of our predictions in samples with varying levels of completeness. We find including binaries and imposing a completeness limit can both introduce ≳0.1 dex changes in inferred ages. Our results highlight the impact that binary evolution channels can have on the massive star population.},

	Abstract = {The Quintuplet, one of three massive stellar clusters in the Galactic center (GC), is located about 30 pc in projection from Sagittarius A*. We aim at the construction of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) of the cluster to study its evolution and to constrain its star-formation history. For this purpose we use the most complete spectral catalog of the Quintuplet stars. Based on the K-band spectra we determine stellar temperatures and luminosities for all stars in the catalog under the assumption of a uniform reddening towards the cluster. We find two groups in the resulting HRD: early-type OB stars and late-type KM stars, well separated from each other. By comparison with Geneva stellar evolution models we derive initial masses exceeding 8 M&sun; for the OB stars. In the HRD these stars are located along an isochrone corresponding to an age of about 4 Myr. This confirms previous considerations, where a similar age estimate was based on the presence of evolved Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster. We derive number ratios for the various spectral subtype groups (e.g. NWR/NO, NWC/NWN) and compare them with predictions of population synthesis models. We find that an instantaneous burst of star formation at about 3.3 to 3.6 Myr ago is the most likely scenario to form the Quintuplet cluster. Furthermore, we apply a mass-luminosity relation to construct the initial mass function (IMF) of the cluster. We find indications for a slightly top-heavy IMF. The late-type stars in the LHO catalog are red giant branch (RGB) stars or red supergiants (RSGs) according to their spectral signatures. Under the assumption that they are located at about the distance of the Galactic center we can derive their luminosities. The comparison with stellar evolution models reveals that the initial masses of these stars are lower than 15 M&sun; implying that they needed about 15 Myr (RSG) or even more than 30 Myr (RGB) to evolve into their present stage. It might be suspected that these late-type stars do not physically belong to the Quintuplet cluster. Indeed, most of them disqualify as cluster members because their radial velocities differ too much from the cluster average. Nevertheless, five of the brightest RGB/RSG stars from the LHO catalog share the mean radial velocity of the Quintuplet, and thus remain highly suspect for being gravitationally bound members. If so, this would challenge the cluster formation and evolution scenario.},

	Abstract = {The Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis suite of binary stellar evolution models and synthetic stellar populations provides a framework for the physically motivated analysis of both the integrated light from distant stellar populations and the detailed properties of those nearby. We present a new version 2.1 data release of these models, detailing the methodology by which Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis incorporates binary mass transfer and its effect on stellar evolution pathways, as well as the construction of simple stellar populations. We demonstrate key tests of the latest Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis model suite demonstrating its ability to reproduce the colours and derived properties of resolved stellar populations, including well-constrained eclipsing binaries. We consider observational constraints on the ratio of massive star types and the distribution of stellar remnant masses. We describe the identification of supernova progenitors in our models, and demonstrate a good agreement to the properties of observed progenitors. We also test our models against photometric and spectroscopic observations of unresolved stellar populations, both in the local and distant Universe, finding that binary models provide a self-consistent explanation for observed galaxy properties across a broad redshift range. Finally, we carefully describe the limitations of our models, and areas where we expect to see significant improvement in future versions.},

	Abstract = {We present 5201 radial-velocity (RV) measurements of 1144 stars as part of an ongoing study of the young (150 Myr) open cluster M35 (NGC 2168). We have observed M35 since 1997, using the Hydra Multi-Object Spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. Our stellar sample covers main-sequence stars over a magnitude range of 13.0 <= V <= 16.5 (1.6-0.8 M sun) and extends spatially to a radius of 30 arcmin (7 pc in projection at a distance of 805 pc or ~4 core radii). Due to its youth, M35 provides a sample of late-type stars with a range of rotation periods. Therefore, we analyze the RV measurement precision as a function of the projected rotational velocity. For narrow-lined stars (vsin i<= 10 km s-1), the RVs have a precision of 0.5 km s-1, which degrades to 1.0 km s-1 for stars with vsin i = 50 km s-1. The RV distribution shows a well-defined cluster peak with a central velocity of -8.16 $\pm$ 0.05 km s-1, permitting a clean separation of the cluster and field stars. For stars with >=3 measurements, we derive RV membership probabilities and identify RV variables, finding 360 cluster members, 55 of which show significant RV variability. Using these cluster members, we construct a color-magnitude diagram for our stellar sample cleaned of field star contamination. We also compare the spatial distribution of the single and binary cluster members, finding no evidence for mass segregation in our stellar sample. Accounting for measurement precision, we place an upper limit on the RV dispersion of the cluster of 0.81 $\pm$ 0.08 km s-1. After correction for undetected binaries, we derive a true RV dispersion of 0.65 $\pm$ 0.10 km s-1.},

	Abstract = {The two Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters, NGC 1805 and NGC 1818, are approximately the same chronological age (˜30 Myr), but show different radial trends in binary frequency. The F-type stars (1.3-2.2 M&sun;) in NGC 1818 have a binary frequency that decreases toward the core, while the binary frequency for stars of similar mass in NGC 1805 is flat with radius, or perhaps bimodal (with a peak in the core). We show here, through detailed N-body modeling, that both clusters could have formed with the same primordial binary frequency and with binary orbital elements and masses drawn from the same distributions (defined from observations of open clusters and the field of our Galaxy). The observed radial trends in binary frequency for both clusters are best matched with models that have initial substructure. Furthermore, both clusters may be evolving along a very similar dynamical sequence, with the key difference that NGC 1805 is dynamically older than NGC 1818. The F-type binaries in NGC 1818 still show evidence of an initial period of rapid dynamical disruptions (which occur preferentially in the core), while NGC 1805 has already begun to recover a higher core binary frequency, owing to mass segregation (which will eventually produce a distribution in binary frequency that rises only toward the core, as is observed in old Milky Way star clusters). This recovery rate increases for higher-mass binaries, and therefore even at one age in one cluster, we predict a similar dynamical sequence in the radial distribution of the binary frequency as a function of binary primary mass.},

	Abstract = {We compile observations of early-type binaries identified via spectroscopy, eclipses, long-baseline interferometry, adaptive optics, common proper motion, etc. Each observational technique is sensitive to companions across a narrow parameter space of orbital periods P and mass ratios q = {M}{comp}/M 1. After combining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their respective selection effects, we find that the properties of companions to O-type and B-type main-sequence (MS) stars differ among three regimes. First, at short orbital periods P ≲ 20 days (separations a ≲ 0.4 au), the binaries have small eccentricities e ≲ 0.4, favor modest mass ratios < q> ≈ 0.5, and exhibit a small excess of twins q > 0.95. Second, the companion frequency peaks at intermediate periods log P (days) ≈ 3.5 (a ≈ 10 au), where the binaries have mass ratios weighted toward small values q ≈ 0.2-0.3 and follow a Maxwellian ``thermal'' eccentricity distribution. Finally, companions with long orbital periods log P (days) ≈ 5.5-7.5 (a ≈ 200-5000 au) are outer tertiary components in hierarchical triples and have a mass ratio distribution across q ≈ 0.1-1.0 that is nearly consistent with random pairings drawn from the initial mass function. We discuss these companion distributions and properties in the context of binary-star formation and evolution. We also reanalyze the binary statistics of solar-type MS primaries, taking into account that 30% $\pm$ 10% of single-lined spectroscopic binaries likely contain white dwarf companions instead of low-mass stellar secondaries. The mean frequency of stellar companions with q > 0.1 and log P (days) < 8.0 per primary increases from 0.50 $\pm$ 0.04 for solar-type MS primaries to 2.1 $\pm$ 0.3 for O-type MS primaries. We fit joint probability density functions f({M}1,q,P,e)\ne f({M}1)f(q)f(P)f(e) to the corrected distributions, which can be incorporated into binary population synthesis studies.},

	Abstract = {We use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the statistical challenges of constraining the characteristic mass (mc) and width (sigma) of a lognormal sub-solar initial mass function (IMF) in Local Group dwarf galaxies using direct star counts. For a typical Milky Way (MW) satellite (MV = -8), jointly constraining mc and sigma to a precision of ≲ 20 per cent requires that observations be complete to ≲ 0.2 M&sun;, if the IMF is similar to the MW IMF. A similar statistical precision can be obtained if observations are only complete down to 0.4 M&sun;, but this requires measurement of nearly 100× more stars, and thus, a significantly more massive satellite (MV ˜ -12). In the absence of sufficiently deep data to constrain the low-mass turnover, it is common practice to fit a single-sloped power law to the low-mass IMF, or to fit mc for a lognormal while holding sigma fixed. We show that the former approximation leads to best-fitting power-law slopes that vary with the mass range observed and can largely explain existing claims of low-mass IMF variations in MW satellites, even if satellite galaxies have the same IMF as the MW. In addition, fixing sigma during fitting leads to substantially underestimated uncertainties in the recovered value of mc (by a factor of ˜4 for typical observations). If the IMFs of nearby dwarf galaxies are lognormal and do vary, observations must reach down to ˜mc in order to robustly detect these variations. The high-sensitivity, near-infrared capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope have the potential to dramatically improve constraints on the low-mass IMF. We present an efficient observational strategy for using these facilities to measure the IMFs of Local Group dwarf galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The mass distribution of compact objects provides a fossil record that can be studied to uncover information on the late stages of massive star evolution, the supernova explosion mechanism, and the dense matter equation of state. Observations of neutron star masses indicate a bimodal Gaussian distribution, while the observed black hole mass distribution decays exponentially for stellar-mass black holes. We use these observed distributions to directly confront the predictions of stellar evolution models and the neutrino-driven supernova simulations of Sukhbold et al. We find strong agreement between the black hole and low-mass neutron star distributions created by these simulations and the observations. We show that a large fraction of the stellar envelope must be ejected, either during the formation of stellar-mass black holes or prior to the implosion through tidal stripping due to a binary companion, in order to reproduce the observed black hole mass distribution. We also determine the origins of the bimodal peaks of the neutron star mass distribution, finding that the low-mass peak (centered at ˜1.4 M &sun;) originates from progenitors with M ZAMS ≈ 9-18 M &sun;. The simulations fail to reproduce the observed peak of high-mass neutron stars (centered at ˜1.8 M &sun;) and we explore several possible explanations. We argue that the close agreement between the observed and predicted black hole and low-mass neutron star mass distributions provides new, promising evidence that these stellar evolution and explosion models capture the majority of relevant stellar, nuclear, and explosion physics involved in the formation of compact objects.},

@article{Rasskazov:2019lp,
	Abstract = {We consider a black hole (BH) density cusp in a nuclear star cluster (NSC) hosting a supermassive back hole (SMBH) at its center. Assuming the stars and BHs inside the SMBH sphere of influence are mass-segregated, we calculate the number of BHs that sink into this region under the influence of dynamical friction. We find that the total number of BHs increases significantly in this region due to this process for lower mass SMBHs by up to a factor of 5, but there is no increase in the vicinity of the highest mass SMBHs. Due to the high BH number density in the NSC, BH-BH binaries form during close approaches due to GW emission. We update the previous estimate of O'Leary et al. for the rate of such GW capture events by estimating the $\langle n^2\rangle/\langle n\rangle^2$ parameter where $n$ is the number density. We find a BH merger rate for this channel to be in the range $\sim0.01-0.1 \, \mathrm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. The total merger rate is dominated by the smallest galaxies hosting SMBHs, and the number of heaviest BHs in the NSC. It is also exponentially sensitive to the radial number density profile exponent, reaching $>100 \, \mathrm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ when the BH mass function is $m^{-2.3}$ or shallower and the heaviest BH radial number density is close to $r^{-3}$. Even if the rate is much lower than the range constrained by the current LIGO detections, the GW captures around SMBHs can be distinguished by their high eccentricity in the LIGO band.},

We determined the recent formation history and the initial mass function (IMF) of massive stars in 30 Doradus on the basis of spectroscopic observations of 247 stars more massive than 15 solar masses (M&sun;). The main episode of massive star formation began about 8 million years (My) ago, and the star-formation rate seems to have declined in the last 1 My. The IMF is densely sampled up to 200 M&sun; and contains 32 $\pm$ 12% more stars above 30 M&sun; than predicted by a standard Salpeter IMF. In the mass range of 15 to 200 M&sun;, the IMF power-law exponent is 1.90-0.26+0.37, shallower than the Salpeter value of 2.35.},

	Abstract = {The 30 Doradus (30 Dor) nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the brightest HII region in the Local Group and a prototype starburst similar to those found in high redshift galaxies. It is thus a stepping stone to understand the complex formation processes of stars in starburst regions across the Universe. Here, we have studied the formation history of massive stars in 30 Dor using masses and ages derived for 452 mainly OB stars from the spectroscopic VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS). We find that stars of all ages and masses are scattered throughout 30 Dor. This is remarkable because it implies that massive stars either moved large distances or formed independently over the whole field of view in relative isolation. We find that both channels contribute to the 30 Dor massive star population. Massive star formation rapidly accelerated about 8 Myr ago, first forming stars in the field before giving birth to the stellar populations in NGC 2060 and NGC 2070. The R136 star cluster in NGC 2070 formed last and, since then, about 1 Myr ago, star formation seems to be diminished with some continuing in the surroundings of R136. Massive stars within a projected distance of 8 pc of R136 are not coeval but show an age range of up to 6 Myr. Our mass distributions are well populated up to 200 M&sun;. The inferred IMF is shallower than a Salpeter-like IMF and appears to be the same across 30 Dor. By comparing our sample of stars to stellar models in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, we find evidence for missing physics in the models above log L/L&sun; = 6 that is likely connected to enhanced wind mass loss for stars approaching the Eddington limit. Our work highlights the key information about the formation, evolution and final fates of massive stars encapsulated in the stellar content of 30 Dor, and sets a new benchmark for theories of massive star formation in giant molecular clouds.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under programme ID 182.D-0222.},

	Abstract = {This review examines the state-of-the-art knowledge of high-mass star and massive cluster formation, gained from ambitious observational surveys, which acknowledges the multiscale characteristics of these processes. After a brief overview of theoretical models and main open issues, we present observational searches for the evolutionary phases of high-mass star formation, first among high-luminosity sources and more recently among young massive protostars and the elusive high-mass prestellar cores. We then introduce the most likely evolutionary scenario for high-mass star formation, which emphasizes the link of high-mass star formation to massive cloud and cluster formation. Finally, we introduce the first attempts to search for variations of the star-formation activity and cluster formation in molecular cloud complexes in the most extreme star-forming sites and across the Milky Way. The combination of Galactic plane surveys and high-angular resolution images with submillimeter facilities such as Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) are prerequisites to make significant progress in the forthcoming decade.},

	Abstract = {The existence of a `density cusp'---a localized increase in number---of stellar-mass black holes near a supermassive black hole is a fundamental prediction of galactic stellar dynamics. The best place to detect such a cusp is in the Galactic Centre, where the nearest supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, resides. As many as 20,000 black holes are predicted to settle into the central parsec of the Galaxy as a result of dynamical friction; however, so far no density cusp of black holes has been detected. Low-mass X-ray binary systems that contain a stellar-mass black hole are natural tracers of isolated black holes. Here we report observations of a dozen quiescent X-ray binaries in a density cusp within one parsec of Sagittarius A*. The lower-energy emission spectra that we observed in these binaries is distinct from the higher-energy spectra associated with the population of accreting white dwarfs that dominates the central eight parsecs of the Galaxy. The properties of these X-ray binaries, in particular their spatial distribution and luminosity function, suggest the existence of hundreds of binary systems in the central parsec of the Galaxy and many more isolated black holes. We cannot rule out a contribution to the observed emission from a population (of up to about one-half the number of X-ray binaries) of rotationally powered, millisecond pulsars. The spatial distribution of the binary systems is a relic of their formation history, either in the stellar disk around Sagittarius A* (ref. 7) or through in-fall from globular clusters, and constrains the number density of sources in the modelling of gravitational waves from massive stellar remnants, such as neutron stars and black holes.},

	Abstract = {We present an ≈11.5 yr adaptive optics (AO) study of stellar variability and search for eclipsing binaries in the central ~0.4 pc (~10") of the Milky Way nuclear star cluster. We measure the photometry of 563 stars using the Keck II NIRC2 imager (K'-band, lambda 0 = 2.124 mum). We achieve a photometric uncertainty floor of Deltam  K' ~ 0.03 (≈3%), comparable to the highest precision achieved in other AO studies. Approximately half of our sample (50% $\pm$ 2%) shows variability: 52% $\pm$ 5% of known early-type young stars and 43% $\pm$ 4% of known late-type giants are variable. These variability fractions are higher than those of other young, massive star populations or late-type giants in globular clusters, and can be largely explained by two factors. First, our experiment time baseline is sensitive to long-term intrinsic stellar variability. Second, the proper motion of stars behind spatial inhomogeneities in the foreground extinction screen can lead to variability. We recover the two known Galactic center eclipsing binary systems: IRS 16SW and S4-258 (E60). We constrain the Galactic center eclipsing binary fraction of known early-type stars to be at least 2.4% $\pm$ 1.7%. We find no evidence of an eclipsing binary among the young S-stars nor among the young stellar disk members. These results are consistent with the local OB eclipsing binary fraction. We identify a new periodic variable, S2-36, with a 39.43 days period. Further observations are necessary to determine the nature of this source.},

	Abstract = {Precision measurements of the stars in short-period orbits around the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center are now being used to constrain general relativistic effects, such as the gravitational redshift and periapse precession. One of the largest systematic uncertainties in the measured orbits has been errors in the astrometric reference frame, which is derived from seven infrared-bright stars associated with SiO masers that have extremely accurate radio positions, measured in the Sgr A*-rest frame. We have improved the astrometric reference frame within 14'' of the Galactic Center by a factor of 2.5 in position and a factor of 5 in proper motion. In the new reference frame, Sgr A* is localized to within a position of 0.645 mas and proper motion of 0.03 mas/yr. We have removed a substantial rotation (2.25 degrees per decade), that was present in the previous less-accurate reference frame used to measure stellar orbits in the field. With our improved methods and continued monitoring of the masers, we predict that orbital precession predicted by General Relativity will become detectable in the next ~5 years.},

	Abstract = {We investigate galactic winds driven by supernova (SN) explosions in an isolated dwarf galaxy using high-resolution (particle mass m_gas = 1 M_&sun;, number of neighbour Nngb = 100) smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations that include non-equilibrium cooling and chemistry, individual star formation, stellar feedback, and metal enrichment. Clustered SNe lead to the formation of superbubbles which break out of the disc and vent out hot gas, launching the winds. We find much weaker winds than what cosmological simulations typically adopt at this mass scale. At the virial radius, the time-averaged loading factors of mass, momentum, and energy are 3, 1, and 0.05, respectively, and the metal enrichment factor is 1.5. Winds that escape the halo consist of two populations that differ in their launching temperatures. Hot gas acquires enough kinetic energy to escape when launched while warm gas does not. However, warm gas can be further accelerated by the ram pressure of the subsequently launched hot gas and eventually escape. The strong interactions between different temperature phases highlight the caveat of extrapolating properties of warm gas to large distances based on its local conditions (e.g. the Bernoulli parameter). Our convergence study finds that wind properties converge when the cooling masses of individual SNe are resolved, which corresponds to m_gas=5 M_&sun; with an injection mass of 500 M_&sun;. The winds weaken dramatically once the SNe become unresolved. We demonstrate that injecting the terminal momentum of SNe, a popular sub-grid model in the literature fails to capture SN winds irrespective of the inclusion of residual thermal energy.},

	Abstract = {We present optical photometry of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)/Wide Field Camera (WFC) data of the resolved stellar populations in the outer disc of the dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 154. The photometry reveals that young main sequence (MS) stars are almost absent from the outermost H I disc. Instead, most are clustered near the main stellar component of the galaxy. We constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by comparing the luminosity function of the MS stars to simulated stellar populations, assuming a constant star formation rate over the dynamical time-scale. The best-fitting IMF is deficient in high-mass stars compared to a canonical Kroupa IMF, with a best-fitting slope alpha = -2.45 and upper mass limit MU = 16 M&sun;. This top-light IMF is consistent with predictions of the integrated galactic IMF theory. Combining the HST images with H I data from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS), we determine the star formation law (SFL) in the outer disc. The fit has a power-law exponent N = 2.92 $\pm$ 0.22 and zero-point A = 4.47 $\pm$ 0.65 × 10-7 M&sun; yr-1 kpc-2. This is depressed compared to the Kennicutt-Schmidt SFL, but consistent with weak star formation observed in diffuse H I environments. Extrapolating the SFL over the outer disc implies that there could be significant star formation occurring that is not detectable in H alpha. Last, we determine the Toomre stability parameter Q of the outer disc of DDO 154 using the THINGS H I rotation curve and velocity dispersion map. 72 per cent of the H I in our field has Q <= 4 and this incorporates 96 per cent of the observed MS stars. Hence, 28 per cent of the H I in the field is largely dormant.},

	Abstract = {The high-precision astrometry from the second data release of the Gaia mission has made it possible to greatly improve the census of members of nearby clusters and associations. I have applied the Gaia data to the Taurus star-forming region, refining the sample of known members and identifying candidates for undiscovered members. The resulting samples of members and candidates provide the best constraints to date on the distribution of ages and the initial mass function (IMF) in Taurus. Several studies over the last 30 years have proposed the existence of a population of older stars (≳10 Myr) that is associated with the Taurus clouds. The data from Gaia demonstrate that such a population does not exist. Meanwhile, previous IMF estimates for small fields surrounding the Taurus aggregates have exhibited a surplus of K7--M0 stars (0.7--0.8 M &sun;) relative to star-forming clusters such as IC 348 and the Orion Nebula Cluster. However, that difference disappears when the new census of the entire region is considered, which should be complete for spectral types earlier than M6--M7 at A  J  < 1. Thus, there is little variation in the stellar IMF across the 3--4 orders of magnitude in stellar density that are present in nearby star-forming regions. Finally, I note that the proper motions of two previously known members, KPNO 15 and 2MASS J04355209 + 2255039, indicate that they may have been ejected from the same location within the L1536 cloud ~7200 years ago.

	Abstract = {The clusters of young stars in massive star-forming regions show a wide range of sizes, morphologies, and numbers of stars. Their highly subclustered structures are revealed by the MYStIX project's sample of 31,754 young stars in nearby sites of star formation (regions at distances <3.6 kpc that contain at least one O-type star.) In 17 of the regions surveyed by MYStIX, we identify subclusters of young stars using finite mixture models---collections of isothermal ellipsoids that model individual subclusters. Maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate the model parameters, and the Akaike Information Criterion is used to determine the number of subclusters. This procedure often successfully finds famous subclusters, such as the BN/KL complex behind the Orion Nebula Cluster and the KW-object complex in M 17. A catalog of 142 subclusters is presented, with 1-20 subclusters per region. The subcluster core radius distribution for this sample is peaked at 0.17 pc with a standard deviation of 0.43 dex, and subcluster core radius is negatively correlated with gas/dust absorption of the stars---a possible age effect. Based on the morphological arrangements of subclusters, we identify four classes of spatial structure: long chains of subclusters, clumpy structures, isolated clusters with a core-halo structure, and isolated clusters well fit by a single isothermal ellipsoid.},

	Abstract = {The birth of stars and the formation of galaxies are cornerstones of modern astrophysics. While much is known about how galaxies globally and their stars individually form and evolve, one fundamental property that affects both remains elusive. This is problematic because this key property, the birth mass distribution of stars, referred to as the stellar initial mass function, is a key tracer of the physics of star formation that underpins almost all of the unknowns in galaxy and stellar evolution. It is perhaps the greatest source of systematic uncertainty in star and galaxy evolution. The past decade has seen a growing variety of methods for measuring or inferring the initial mass function. This range of approaches and evolving definitions of the quantity being measured has in turn led to conflicting conclusions regarding whether or not the initial mass function is universal. Here I review this growing wealth of approaches, and highlight the importance of considering potential initial mass function variations, reinforcing the need to carefully quantify the scope and uncertainties of measurements. I present a new framework to aid the discussion of the initial mass function and promote clarity in the further development of this fundamental field.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the effect of a metallicity-dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF), as deduced observationally by Mart{\'\i}n-Navarro et al., on the inferred stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) of a representative sample of 186 886 SDSS galaxies. Relative to a Chabrier IMF, for which we show the implied masses to be close to minimal, the inferred masses increase in both the low- and high-metallicity regimes due to the addition of stellar remnants and dwarf stars, respectively. The resulting galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) shifts towards higher masses by 0.5 dex, without affecting the high-mass slope (and thus the need for effective quenching). The implied low-redshift SFR density increases by an order of magnitude. However, these results depend strongly on the assumed IMF parametrization, which is not directly constrained by the observations. Varying the low-end IMF slope instead of the high-end IMF slope, while maintaining the same dwarf-to-giant ratio, results in a much more modest GSMF shift of 0.2 dex and a 10 per cent increase in the SFR density relative to the Chabrier IMF. A bottom-heavy IMF during the late, metal-rich evolutionary stage of a galaxy would help explain the rapid quenching and the bimodality in the galaxy population by on the one hand making galaxies less quenched (due to the continued formation of dwarf stars) and on the other hand reducing the gas consumption time-scale. We conclude that the implications of the observational evidence for a variable IMF could vary from absolutely dramatic to mild but significant.},

	Abstract = {Observational and theoretical arguments increasingly suggest that the initial mass function (IMF) of stars may depend systematically on environment, yet most galaxy formation models to date assume a universal IMF. Here, we investigate simulations of the formation of Milky Way analogues run ab initio with an empirically derived metallicity-dependent IMF and the moving-mesh code AREPO in order to characterize the associated uncertainties. In particular, we compare a constant Chabrier and a varying metallicity-dependent IMF in cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-sized haloes. We find that the non-linear effects due to IMF variations typically have a limited impact on the morphology and the star formation histories of the formed galaxies. Our results support the view that constraints on stellar-to-halo mass ratios, feedback strength, metallicity evolution, and metallicity distributions are in part degenerate with the effects of a non-universal, metallicity-dependent IMF. Interestingly, the empirical relation we use between metallicity and the high-mass slope of the IMF does not aid in the quenching process. It actually produces up to a factor of 2-3 more stellar mass if feedback is kept constant. Additionally, the enrichment history and the z = 0 metallicity distribution are significantly affected. In particular, the alpha enhancement pattern shows a steeper dependence on iron abundance in the metallicity-dependent model, in better agreement with observational constraints.},

	Abstract = {Recent results on the non-universality of the Initial Mass Function (IMF) have shown strong evidence of IMF variations with galaxy velocity dispersion, with a corresponding impact on other stellar population parameters, line indices and colours. Using a set of stellar population models with varying IMF slopes, we provide additional caveats on the assumption of a universal IMF. This study shows that the derived star formation histories of early-type galaxies vary significantly with the IMF slope. For instance, a steepening in the slope of a single power-law IMF decreases substantially, by a factor of up to 4, the contribution of the old stellar populations to the total light/mass. This trend is milder for a segmented-like IMF shape, where the contribution of the very low mass stars is decreased. It is also shown that, by tuning each IMF slope to its prescribed value according to each galaxy velocity dispersion, a sample of early-type galaxies covering a range of masses yield comparable star formation histories. On the one hand, a small contribution from relatively young stellar populations appears in the star formation histories of most massive elliptical galaxies when adopting a steep IMF. In addition, we find that low-mass early-type galaxies that look like genuinely young objects with a standard IMF (i.e. `baby elliptical galaxies') turn out to be older when a slightly flatter IMF is employed. In summary, the use of a non-universal IMF, tuned according to the velocity dispersion of the galaxy, seems to provide more consistent results.},

	Abstract = {Six gravitational wave detections have been reported so far, providing crucial insights on the merger rate of double compact objects. We investigate the cosmic merger rate of double neutron stars (DNSs), neutron star black hole binaries (NSBHs), and black hole binaries (BHBs) by means of population-synthesis simulations coupled with the Illustris cosmological simulation. We have performed six different simulations, considering different assumptions for the efficiency of common envelope (CE) ejection and exploring two distributions for the supernova (SN) kicks. The current BHB merger rate derived from our simulations spans from ˜150 to ˜240 Gpc-3 yr-1 and is only mildly dependent on CE efficiency. In contrast, the current merger rates of DNSs (ranging from ˜20 to ˜600 Gpc-3 yr-1) and NSBHs (ranging from ˜10 to ˜100 Gpc-3 yr-1) strongly depend on the assumptions on CE and natal kicks. The merger rate of DNSs is consistent with the one inferred from the detection of GW170817 only if a high efficiency of CE ejection and low-SN kicks (drawn from a Maxwellian distribution with one-dimensional root mean square sigma = 15 km s-1) are assumed.},

	Abstract = {We present constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in two ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, Hercules and Leo IV, based on deep Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging. The Hercules and Leo IV galaxies are extremely low luminosity (MV = -6.2, -5.5), metal-poor (lang[Fe/H]rang = -2.4, -2.5) systems that have old stellar populations (>11 Gyr). Because they have long relaxation times, we can directly measure the low-mass stellar IMF by counting stars below the main-sequence turnoff without correcting for dynamical evolution. Over the stellar mass range probed by our data, 0.52-0.77 M &sun;, the IMF is best fit by a power-law slope of \alpha = 1.2_{-0.5}^{+0.4} for Hercules and alpha = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.8 for Leo IV. For Hercules, the IMF slope is more shallow than a Salpeter (alpha = 2.35) IMF at the 5.8sigma level, and a Kroupa (alpha = 2.3 above 0.5 M &sun;) IMF slope at 5.4sigma level. We simultaneously fit for the binary fraction, f binary, finding f_binary = 0.47^{+0.16}_{-0.14} for Hercules, and 0.47^{+0.37}_{-0.17} for Leo IV. The UFD binary fractions are consistent with that inferred for Milky Way stars in the same mass range, despite very different metallicities. In contrast, the IMF slopes in the UFDs are shallower than other galactic environments. In the mass range 0.5-0.8 M &sun;, we see a trend across the handful of galaxies with directly measured IMFs such that the power-law slopes become shallower (more bottom-light) with decreasing galactic velocity dispersion and metallicity. This trend is qualitatively consistent with results in elliptical galaxies inferred via indirect methods and is direct evidence for IMF variations with galactic environment.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at STScI, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the mass distribution of stars at the time of their formation and is of fundamental importance for many areas of astrophysics. The IMF is reasonably well constrained in the disk of the Milky Way but we have very little direct information on the form of the IMF in other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. Here we report observations of the NaI doublet and the Wing-Ford molecular FeH band in the spectra of elliptical galaxies. These lines are strong in stars with masses less than 0.3Msolar (where Msolar is the mass of the Sun) and are weak or absent in all other types of stars. We unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previous studies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. The direct detection of the light of low-mass stars implies that they are very abundant in elliptical galaxies, making up over 80% of the total number of stars and contributing more than 60% of the total stellar mass. We infer that the IMF in massive star-forming galaxies in the early Universe produced many more low-mass stars than the IMF in the Milky Way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than the Salpeter form in the mass range 0.1Msolar to 1Msolar.},

	Abstract = {As a young massive cluster in the central molecular zone, the Arches cluster is a valuable probe of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in the extreme Galactic center environment. We use multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope observations to obtain high-precision proper-motion and photometric measurements of the cluster, calculating cluster membership probabilities for stars down to ~1.8 M &sun; between cluster radii of 0.25 and 3.0 pc. We achieve a cluster sample with just ~6% field contamination, a significant improvement over photometrically selected samples that are severely compromised by the differential extinction across the field. Combining this sample with K-band spectroscopy of five cluster members, we forward model the Arches cluster to simultaneously constrain its IMF and other properties (such as age and total mass) while accounting for observational uncertainties, completeness, mass segregation, and stellar multiplicity. We find that the Arches IMF is best described by a one-segment power law that is significantly top-heavy: alpha = 1.80 $\pm$ 0.05 (stat) $\pm$ 0.06 (sys), where dN/dm ∝ m -alpha , though we cannot discount a two-segment power-law model with a high-mass slope only slightly shallower than local star-forming regions (alpha ={2.04}-0.19+0.14+/- 0.04) but with a break at {5.8}-1.2+3.2+/- 0.02 {M}o . In either case, the Arches IMF is significantly different than the standard IMF. Comparing the Arches to other young massive clusters in the Milky Way, we find tentative evidence for a systematically top-heavy IMF at the Galactic center.},

	Abstract = {We present significantly improved proper motion measurements of the Milky Way's central stellar cluster. These improvements are made possible by refining our astrometric reference frame with a new geometric optical distortion model for the W. M. Keck II 10 m telescope's adaptive optics camera (NIRC2) in its narrow field mode. For the first time, this distortion model is constructed from on-sky measurements and is made available to the public in the form of FITS files. When applied to widely dithered images, it produces residuals in the separations of stars that are a factor of ~3 smaller compared with the outcome using previous models. By applying this new model, along with corrections for differential atmospheric refraction, to widely dithered images of SiO masers at the Galactic center (GC), we improve our ability to tie into the precisely measured radio Sgr A*-rest frame. The resulting infrared reference frame is ~2-3 times more accurate and stable than earlier published efforts. In this reference frame, Sgr A* is localized to within a position of 0.6 mas and a velocity of 0.09 mas yr-1, or ~3.4 km s-1 at 8 kpc (1sigma). Also, proper motions for members of the central stellar cluster are more accurate, although less precise, due to the limited number of these wide field measurements. These proper motion measurements show that, with respect to Sgr A*, the central stellar cluster has no rotation in the plane of the sky to within 0.3 mas yr-1 arcsec-1, has no net translational motion with respect to Sgr A* to within 0.1 mas yr-1, and has net rotation perpendicular to the plane of the sky along the Galactic plane, as has previously been observed. While earlier proper motion studies defined a reference frame by assuming no net motion of the stellar cluster, this approach is fundamentally limited by the cluster's intrinsic dispersion and therefore will not improve with time. We define a reference frame with SiO masers and this reference frame's stability should improve steadily with future measurements of the SiO masers in this region (vpropt -3/2). This is essential for achieving the necessary reference frame stability required to detect the effects of general relativity and extended mass on short-period stars at the GC.},

	Abstract = {The mean absolute extinction towards the central parsec of the Milky Way is AK ~= 3 mag, including both foreground and Galactic Centre dust. Here we present a measurement of dust extinction within the Galactic old nuclear star cluster (NSC), based on combining differential extinctions of NSC stars with their upsilol proper motions along Galactic longitude. Extinction within the NSC preferentially affects stars at its far side, and because the NSC rotates, this causes higher extinctions for NSC stars with negative upsilol, as well as an asymmetry in the upsilol-histograms. We model these effects using an axisymmetric dynamical model of the NSC in combination with simple models for the dust distribution. Comparing the predicted asymmetry to data for ˜7100 stars in several NSC fields, we find that dust associated with the Galactic Centre mini-spiral with extinction AK ~= 0.15-0.8 mag explains most of the data. The largest extinction AK ~= 0.8 mag is found in the region of the Western arm of the mini-spiral. Comparing with total AK determined from stellar colours, we determine the extinction in front of the NSC. Finally, we estimate that for a typical extinction of AK ~= 0.4 the statistical parallax of the NSC changes by ˜0.4 per cent.},

	Abstract = {We present three-dimensional (3D) kinematic observations of stars within the central 0.5 pc of the Milky Way (MW) nuclear star cluster (NSC) using adaptive optics imaging and spectroscopy from the Keck telescopes. Recent observations have shown that the cluster has a shallower surface density profile than expected for a dynamically relaxed cusp, leading to important implications for its formation and evolution. However, the true 3D profile of the cluster is unknown due to the difficulty in de-projecting the stellar number counts. Here, we use spherical Jeans modeling of individual proper motions and radial velocities to constrain, for the first time, the de-projected spatial density profile, cluster velocity anisotropy, black hole mass (M BH), and distance to the Galactic center (R 0) simultaneously. We find that the inner stellar density profile of the late-type stars, rho(r)vpropr -gamma, have a power law slope \gamma =0.05_{-0.60}^{+0.29}, much more shallow than the frequently assumed Bahcall-Wolf slope of gamma = 7/4. The measured slope will significantly affect dynamical predictions involving the cluster, such as the dynamical friction time scale. The cluster core must be larger than 0.5 pc, which disfavors some scenarios for its origin. Our measurement of M_{BH}=5.76_{-1.26}^{+1.76}\times 10^6 M &sun; and R_0=8.92_{-0.55}^{+0.58} kpc is consistent with that derived from stellar orbits within 1'' of Sgr A*. When combined with the orbit of S0-2, the uncertainty on R 0 is reduced by 30% (8.46_{-0.38}^{+0.42}\ kpc). We suggest that the MW NSC can be used in the future in combination with stellar orbits to significantly improve constraints on R 0.},

	Abstract = {We present an improved data-reduction technique to obtain high-precision proper motions (PMs) of globular clusters (GCs) using Hubble Space Telescope data. The new reduction is superior to the one presented in the first paper of this series for the faintest sources in very crowded fields. We choose the GC NGC 362 as a benchmark to test our new procedures. We measure PMs of 117,450 sources in the field, showing that we are able to obtain a PM precision better than 10 muas yr-1 for bright stars. We make use of this new PM catalog of NGC 362 to study the cluster's internal kinematics. We investigate the velocity dispersion profiles of the multiple stellar populations hosted by NGC 362 and find new pieces of information on the kinematics of first- and second-generation stars. We analyze the level of energy equipartition of the cluster and find direct evidence for its post-core-collapsed state from kinematic arguments alone. We refine the dynamical mass of the blue stragglers (BSs) and study possible kinematic differences between BSs formed by collisions and mass transfer. We also measure no significant cluster rotation in the plane of the sky. Finally, we measure the absolute PM of NGC 362 and of the background stars belonging to the Small Magellanic Cloud, finding a good agreement with previous estimates in the literature. We make the PM catalog publicly available.},

	Abstract = {We present high spatial resolution observations of ground-state OH masers achieved using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). These observations were conducted toward 171 pointing centers where OH maser candidates were identified previously in the Southern Parkes Large-Area Survey in Hydroxyl toward the Galactic center region between Galactic longitudes of 355◦ and 5◦ and Galactic latitudes of -2$\,^{\circ}$ and +2$\,^{\circ}$. We detect maser emission toward 162 target fields and suggest that six out of nine nondetections are due to intrinsic variability. Due to the superior spatial resolution of the follow-up ATCA observations, we have identified 356 OH maser sites in the 162 target fields with maser detections. Almost half (161 of 356) of these maser sites have been detected for the first time in these observations. After comparing the positions of these 356 maser sites to the literature, we find that 269 (76%) sites are associated with evolved stars (two of which are PNe), 31 (9%) are associated with star formation, and four are associated with supernova remnants; we were unable to determine the origin of the remaining 52 (15%) sites. Unlike the pilot region, the infrared colors of evolved star sites with symmetric maser profiles in the 1612 MHz transition do not show obvious differences compared with those of evolved star sites with asymmetric maser profiles.},

	Abstract = {Red clump stars are commonly used to map the reddening and morphology of the inner regions of the Milky Way. We use the new photometric catalogues of the VISTA Variables in the V{\'\i}a L{\'a}ctea survey to achieve twice the spatial resolution of previous reddening maps for Galactic longitudes -10$\,^{\circ}$ < l< 10$\,^{\circ}$ and latitudes -1.5$\,^{\circ}$ < b &lt 1.5$\,^{\circ}$. We use these de-reddened catalogues to construct the Ks luminosity function around the red clump in the Galactic plane. We show that the secondary peak (fainter than the red clump) detected in these regions does not correspond to the bulge red-giant branch bump alone, as previously interpreted. Instead, this fainter clump corresponds largely to the over-density of red clump stars tracing the spiral arm structure behind the Galactic bar. This result suggests that studies aiming to characterize the bulge red-giant branch bump should avoid low galactic latitudes (|b|&lt 2$\,^{\circ}$), where the background red clump population contributes significant contamination. It furthermore highlights the need to include this structural component in future modelling of the Galactic bar.},

@article{Webb:2018eu,
	Abstract = {Understanding the evolution of stellar clusters in an evolving tidal field is critical for studying the disruption of stellar clusters in a cosmological context. We systematically characterise the response of stellar clusters to tidal shocks using controlled $N$-body simulations of clusters with various properties that are subjected to different types of shocks. We find that the strength of the shock and the density of the cluster within the half-mass radius are the dominant properties that drive the amount of mass lost by the cluster, with the shape of the cluster profile being of minor influence. When the shock is applied as two separate sub-shocks, the amount of mass loss during the second sub-shock is sensitive to the gap time between them. Clusters that experience successive sub-shocks separated by less than their crossing time attain the same masses and sizes at the end of the simulation. However, clusters subjected to sub-shocks separated by more than a crossing time experience different evolutionary histories. The amount of mass lost in the $N$-body models and its scaling with shock and cluster properties differs from that predicted by classical tidal disruption theory. We demonstrate that the discrepancy is alleviated by including a dependence on the escape time-scale of unbound stars, analogously to mass loss driven by two-body relaxation. With our new theoretical model for shock-driven mass loss, the predicted relative amounts of mass loss agree with the results of the $N$-body simulations to $\sim0.3 \ \rm{dex}$ across the full suite of simulations.},

	Abstract = {Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is the variable radio, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray source associated with accretion onto the Galactic center black hole. We present an analysis of the most comprehensive NIR variability data set of Sgr A* to date: eight 24 hr epochs of continuous monitoring of Sgr A* at 4.5 mum with the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, 93 epochs of 2.18 mum data from Naos Conica at the Very Large Telescope, and 30 epochs of 2.12 mum data from the NIRC2 camera at the Keck Observatory, in total 94,929 measurements. A new approximate Bayesian computation method for fitting the first-order structure function extracts information beyond current fast Fourier transformation (FFT) methods of power spectral density (PSD) estimation. With a combined fit of the data of all three observatories, the characteristic coherence timescale of Sgr A* is {tau }b={243}-57+82 minutes (90% credible interval). The PSD has no detectable features on timescales down to 8.5 minutes (95% credible level), which is the ISCO orbital frequency for a dimensionless spin parameter a = 0.92. One light curve measured simultaneously at 2.12 and 4.5 mum during a low flux-density phase gave a spectral index alpha  s  = 1.6 $\pm$ 0.1 ({F}nu \propto {nu }-{alpha s}). This value implies that the Sgr A* NIR color becomes bluer during higher flux-density phases. The probability densities of flux densities of the combined data sets are best fit by log-normal distributions. Based on these distributions, the Sgr A* spectral energy distribution is consistent with synchrotron radiation from a non-thermal electron population from below 20 GHz through the NIR.},

	Abstract = {We used 4-yr baseline Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 IR observations of the Galactic Centre in the F153M band (1.53 mum) to identify variable stars in the central ~2.3 arcmin × 2.3 arcmin field. We classified 3845 long-term (periods from months to years) and 76 short-term (periods of a few days or less) variables among a total sample of 33 070 stars. For 36 of the latter ones, we also derived their periods (<3 d). Our catalogue not only confirms bright long period variables and massive eclipsing binaries identified in previous works but also contains many newly recognized dim variable stars. For example, we found delta Scuti and RR Lyrae stars towards the Galactic Centre for the first time, as well as one BL Her star (period < 1.3 d). We cross-correlated our catalogue with previous spectroscopic studies and found that 319 variables have well-defined stellar types, such as Wolf-Rayet, OB main sequence, supergiants and asymptotic giant branch stars. We used colours and magnitudes to infer the probable variable types for those stars without accurately measured periods or spectroscopic information. We conclude that the majority of unclassified variables could potentially be eclipsing/ellipsoidal binaries and Type II Cepheids. Our source catalogue will be valuable for future studies aimed at constraining the distance, star formation history and massive binary fraction of the Milky Way nuclear star cluster.},

@article{Reid:2007jk,
	Abstract = {In the first two papers of this series, we determined the position of Sgr A* on infrared images by aligning the positions of red giant stars with positions measured at radio wavelengths for their circumstellar SiO masers. In this paper, we report the detections of five new stellar SiO masers within 50" (2 pc) of Sgr A* and new and/or improved positions and proper motions of 15 stellar SiO masers. The current accuracies are ~1 mas in position and ~0.3 mas yr-1 in proper motion. We find that the proper motion of the central stellar cluster with respect to Sgr A* is less than 45 km s-1. One star, IRS 9, has a three-dimensional speed of ~370 km s -1 at a projected distance of 0.33 pc from Sgr A*. If IRS 9 is bound to the inner parsec, this requires an enclosed mass that exceeds current estimates of the sum of the mass of Sgr A* and luminous stars in the stellar cusp by ~0.8×106 Msolar. Possible explanations include: (1) that IRS 9 is not bound to the central parsec and has ``fallen'' from a radius greater than 9 pc, (2) that a cluster of dark stellar remnants accounts for some of the excess mass, and/or (3) that R0 is considerably greater than 8 kpc.},

@article{Webb:2018yq,
	Abstract = {Through a suite of direct N-body simulations, we explore how the structural and kinematic evolution of a star cluster located at the center of a dwarf galaxy is affected by the shape of its host's dark matter density profile. The stronger central tidal fields of cuspier halos minimize the cluster's ability to expand in response to mass loss due to stellar evolution during its early evolutionary stages and during its subsequent long-term evolution driven by two-body relaxation. Hence clusters evolving in cuspier dark matter halos are characterized by more compact sizes, higher velocity dispersions and remain approximately isotropic at all clustercentric distances. Conversely, clusters in cored halos can expand more and develop a velocity distribution profile that becomes increasingly radially anisotropic at larger clustercentric distances. Finally, the larger velocity dispersion of clusters evolving in cuspier dark matter profiles results in them having longer relaxation times. Hence clusters in cuspy galaxies relax at a slower rate and, consequently, they are both less mass segregated and farther from complete energy equipartition than cluster's in cored galaxies. Application of this work to observations allows for star clusters to be used as tools to measure the distribution of dark matter in dwarf galaxies and to distinguish isolated star clusters from ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We examine the dynamical evolution of both Plummer sphere and substructured (fractal) star-forming regions in Galactic Centre (GC) strong tidal fields to see what initial conditions could give rise to an Arches-like massive star cluster by ˜2 Myr. We find that any initial distribution has to be contained within its initial tidal radius to survive, which sets a lower limit of the initial density of the Arches of ˜600 M&sun; pc-3 if the Arches is at 30 pc from the GC, or ˜200 M&sun; pc-3 if the Arches is at 100 pc from the GC. Plummer spheres that survive change little other than to dynamically mass segregate, but initially fractal distributions rapidly erase substructure, dynamically mass segregate and by 2 Myr look extremely similar to initial Plummer spheres, therefore it is almost impossible to determine the initial conditions of clusters in strong tidal fields.},

	Abstract = {Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory provides the opportunity to make precise spatially resolved measurements of the IMF slope in galaxies owing to its unique combination of spatial resolution, wavelength coverage, and sample size. We derive radial gradients in age, element abundances, and IMF slope analysing optical and near-infrared absorption features from stacked spectra out to the half-light radius of 366 early-type galaxies with masses 9.9-10.8 log M/M&sun;. We find flat gradients in age and [alpha/Fe] ratio, as well as negative gradients in metallicity, consistent with the literature. We further derive significant negative gradients in the [Na/Fe] ratio with galaxy centres being well enhanced in Na abundance by up to 0.5 dex. Finally, we find a gradient in IMF slope with a bottom-heavy IMF in the centre (typical mass excess factor of 1.5) and a Milky Way-type IMF at the half-light radius. This pattern is mass dependent with the lowest mass galaxies in our sample featuring only a shallow gradient around a Milky Way IMF. Our results imply the local IMF-sigma relation within galaxies to be even steeper than the global relation and hint towards the local metallicity being the dominating factor behind the IMF variations. We also employ different stellar population models in our analysis and show that a radial IMF gradient is found independently of the stellar population model used. A similar analysis of the Wing-Ford band provides inconsistent results and further evidence of the difficulty in measuring and modelling this particular feature.},

@article{Lohr:2018qy,
	Abstract = {We have carried out a spectroscopic variability survey of some of the most massive stars in the Arches cluster, using K-band observations obtained with SINFONI on the VLT. One target, F2, exhibits substantial changes in radial velocity (RV); in combination with new KMOS and archival SINFONI spectra, its primary component is found to undergo RV variation with a period of 10.483 $\pm$ 0.002 d and an amplitude of  350 km s-1. A secondary RV curve is also marginally detectable. We reanalysed archival NAOS-CONICA photometric survey data in combination with our RV results to confirm this object as an eclipsing SB2 system, and the first binary identified in the Arches. We have modelled it as consisting of an 82 $\pm$ 12 M&sun; WN8-9h primary and a 60 $\pm$ 8 M&sun; O5-6 Ia+ secondary, and as having a slightly eccentric orbit, implying an evolutionary stage prior to strong binary interaction. As one of four X-ray bright Arches sources previously proposed as colliding-wind massive binaries, it may be only the first of several binaries to be discovered in this cluster, presenting potential challenges to recent models for the Arches' age and composition. It also appears to be one of the most massive binaries detected to date; the primary's calculated initial mass of ≳120 M&sun; would arguably make this the most massive binary known in the Galaxy.  The individual reduced spectra and the two disentangled spectra are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/617/A66.},

	Abstract = {We present a kinematic study of the nuclear stellar disk in M31 at infrared wavelengths using high spatial resolution integral field spectroscopy. The spatial resolution achieved, FWHM = 0."12 (0.45 pc at the distance of M31), has only previously been equaled in spectroscopic studies by space-based long-slit observations. Using adaptive-optics-corrected integral field spectroscopy from the OSIRIS instrument at the W. M. Keck Observatory, we map the line-of-sight kinematics over the entire old stellar eccentric disk orbiting the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at a distance of r < 4 pc. The peak velocity dispersion is 381 $\pm$ 55 km s-1, offset by 0."13 $\pm$ 0."03 from the SMBH, consistent with previous high-resolution long-slit observations. There is a lack of near-infrared (NIR) emission at the position of the SMBH and young nuclear cluster, suggesting a spatial separation between the young and old stellar populations within the nucleus. We compare the observed kinematics with dynamical models from Peiris & Tremaine. The best-fit disk orientation to the NIR flux is [theta  l , theta  i , theta  a ] = [-33$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 4$\,^{\circ}$, 44$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 2$\,^{\circ}$, -15$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 15$\,^{\circ}$], which is tilted with respect to both the larger-scale galactic disk and the best-fit orientation derived from optical observations. The precession rate of the old disk is Omega P  = 0.0 $\pm$ 3.9 km s-1 pc-1, lower than the majority of previous observations. This slow precession rate suggests that stellar winds from the disk will collide and shock, driving rapid gas inflows and fueling an episodic central starburst as suggested in Chang et al.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents accurate absolute positions from a 24 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) search for compact extragalactic sources in an area where the density of known calibrators with precise coordinates is low. The goals were to identify additional sources suitable for use as phase calibrators for galactic sources, determine their precise positions, and produce radio images. In order to achieve these goals, we developed a new software package, PIMA, for determining group delays from wide-band data with much lower detection limits. With the use of PIMA, we have detected 327 sources out of 487 targets observed in three 24 hr VLBA experiments. Among the 327 detected objects, 176 are within 10$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic plane. This VGaPS catalog of source positions, plots of correlated flux density versus projected baseline length, contour plots, as well as weighted CLEAN images, and calibrated visibility data are available on the Web in FITS format. Approximately one-half of objects from the 24 GHz catalog were observed at dual-band 8.6 GHz and 2.3 GHz experiments. Position differences at 24 GHz versus 8.6/2.3 GHz for all but two objects on average are strictly within reported uncertainties. We found that for two objects with complex structures, positions at different frequencies correspond to different components of a source.},

@article{Reid:2004xh,
	Abstract = {We report measurements with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) of the position of Sgr A* with respect to two extragalactic radio sources over a period of 8 yr. The apparent proper motion of Sgr A* relative to J1745-283 is 6.379+/-0.024 mas yr-1 along a position angle of 209.60d+/-0.18d, almost entirely in the plane of the Galaxy. The effects of the orbit of the Sun around the Galactic center can account for this motion, and the residual proper motion of Sgr A* perpendicular to the plane of the Galaxy is -0.4+/-0.9 km s-1. A maximum likelihood analysis of the motion expected for a massive object within the observed Galactic center stellar cluster indicates that Sgr A* contains more than about 10% of the ~4×106 Msolar deduced from stellar orbits. The intrinsic size of Sgr A*, as measured by several investigators, is less than 1 AU, and the implied mass density of ~1022 Msolar pc-3 is within about 3 orders of magnitude of a comparable supermassive black hole within its Schwarzschild radius. Our observations provide the first direct evidence that a compact radiative source at the center of a galaxy contains of order 106 Msolar and provides overwhelming evidence that it is in the form of a supermassive black hole. Finally, the existence of ``intermediate-mass'' black holes more massive than ~104 Msolar between roughly 103 and 105 AU from Sgr A* is excluded.},

	Abstract = {The second release of Gaia data (Gaia DR2) contains the astrometric parameters for more than half a million quasars. This set defines a kinematically non-rotating reference frame in the optical domain referred to as the Gaia-CRF2. The Gaia-CRF2 is the first realisation of a non-rotating global optical reference frame that meets the ICRS prescriptions, meaning that it is built only on extragalactic sources. It consists of the positions of a sample of 556 869 sources in Gaia DR2, obtained from a positional cross-match with the ICRF3-prototype and AllWISE AGN catalogues. The sample constitutes a clean, dense, and homogeneous set of extragalactic point sources in the magnitude range G from 16 to 21 mag with accurately known optical positions. The median positional uncertainty is 0.12 mas for G < 18 mag and 0.5 mas at G = 20 mag. Large-scale systematics are estimated to be in the range 20 to 30 muas. The accuracy claims are supported by the parallaxes and proper motions of the quasars in Gaia DR2. The optical positions for a subset of 2820 sources in common with the ICRF3-prototype show very good overall agreement with the radio positions, but several tens of sources have significantly discrepant positions.},

	Abstract = {Using deep observations obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we demonstrate that the sub-solar stellar initial mass function (IMF) of six ultra-faint dwarf Milky Way satellites (UFDs) is more bottom light than the IMF of the Milky Way disk. Our data have a lower-mass limit of ˜0.45 M &sun;, while the upper limit is ˜0.8 M &sun;, set by the turnoff mass of these old, metal-poor systems. If formulated as a single power law, we obtain a shallower IMF slope than the Salpeter value of -2.3, ranging from -1.01 for Leo IV to -1.87 for Bo{\"o}tes I. The significance of these deviations depends on the galaxy and is typically 95% or more. When modeled as a log-normal, the IMF fit results in a higher peak mass than in the Milky Way disk, but a Milky Way disk value for the characteristic system mass (˜0.22 M &sun;) is excluded at only 68% significance, and only for some UFDs in the sample. We find that the IMF slope correlates well with the galaxy mean metallicity, and to a lesser degree, with the velocity dispersion and the total mass. The strength of the observed correlations is limited by shot noise in the number of observed stars, but future space-based missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope ( WFIRST) will enhance both the number of dwarf Milky Way satellites that can be studied in such detail and the observation depth for individual galaxies.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program GO-12549.},

	Abstract = {We use deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/IR imaging to study the initial mass function (IMF) of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Coma Berenices (Com Ber). Our observations reach the lowest stellar mass ever probed in a resolved galaxy, with 50% completeness at ˜0.17 M &sun;. Unresolved background galaxies, however, limit our purity below ˜0.23 M &sun;. If modeled with a single power law, we find that the IMF slope is -{1.45}-0.3+0.29 (68% credible intervals), compared to a Milky Way value of -2.3. For a broken power law, we obtain a low-mass slope of -{1.18}-0.33+0.49, a high-mass slope of -{1.88}-0.49+0.43, and a break mass of {0.57}-0.08+0.12 M &sun;, compared to -1.3, -2.3, and 0.5 M &sun; for a Kroupa IMF, and for a log-normal IMF model, we obtain values of {0.33}-0.16+0.15 M &sun; for the location parameter and of {0.68}-0.12+0.17 for sigma (0.22 M &sun; and 0.57 for the Chabrier system IMF). All three parameterizations produce similar agreement with the data. Our results agree with previous analyses of shallower optical HST data. However, an analysis of similar optical data of other dwarfs finds IMFs significantly more bottom-light than in the Milky Way. These results suggest two, non-mutually exclusive possibilities: that the discrepancy of the dwarf galaxies' IMF with respect to the Milky Way is at least partly an artifact of using a single-power-law model, and that there is real variance in the IMF at low masses between the currently studied nearby dwarfs, with Com Ber being similar to the Milky Way, but other dwarfs differing significantly.},

	Abstract = {We present new proper motions from the 10 m Keck telescopes for a puzzling population of massive, young stars located within 3farcs5 (0.14 pc) of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center. Our proper motion measurements have uncertainties of only 0.07 mas yr-1 (3 km s-1), which is gsim 7 times better than previous proper motion measurements for these stars, and enables us to measure accelerations as low as 0.2 mas yr-2 (7 km s-1 yr-1). Using these measurements, line-of-sight velocities from the literature, and three-dimensional velocities for additional young stars in the central parsec, we constrain the true orbit of each individual star and directly test the hypothesis that the massive stars reside in two stellar disks as has been previously proposed. Analysis of the stellar orbits reveals only one of the previously proposed disks of young stars using a method that is capable of detecting disks containing at least seven stars. The detected disk contains 50% of the young stars, is inclined by ~115$\,^{\circ}$ from the plane of the sky, and is oriented at a position angle of ~100$\,^{\circ}$ east of north. Additionally, the on-disk and off-disk populations have similar K-band luminosity functions and radial distributions that decrease at larger radii as vpropr -2. The disk has an out-of-the-disk velocity dispersion of 28 $\pm$ 6 km s-1, which corresponds to a half-opening angle of 7$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 2$\,^{\circ}$, and several candidate disk members have eccentricities greater than 0.2. Our findings suggest that the young stars may have formed in situ but in a more complex geometry than a simple, thin circular disk.},

	Abstract = {The Galactic Center is an excellent laboratory for studying phenomena and physical processes that may be occurring in many other galactic nuclei. The center of our Milky Way is by far the closest galactic nucleus, and observations with exquisite resolution and sensitivity cover 18 orders of magnitude in energy of electromagnetic radiation. Theoretical simulations have become increasingly more powerful in explaining these measurements. This review summarizes the recent progress in observational and theoretical work on the central parsec, with a strong emphasis on the current empirical evidence for a central massive black hole and on the processes in the surrounding dense nuclear star cluster. Current evidence is presented, from the analysis of the orbits of more than two dozen stars and from the measurements of the size and motion of the central compact radio source, Sgr  A* , that this radio source must be a massive black hole of about 4.4×106M&sun; , beyond any reasonable doubt. What is known about the structure and evolution of the dense nuclear star cluster surrounding this black hole is reported, including the astounding fact that stars have been forming in the vicinity of Sgr A* recently, apparently with a top-heavy stellar-mass function. A dense concentration of fainter stars centered in the immediate vicinity of the massive black hole are discussed, three of which have orbital peri-bothroi of less than one light day. This ``S-star cluster'' appears to consist mainly of young early-type stars, in contrast to the predicted properties of an equilibrium ``stellar cusp'' around a black hole. This constitutes a remarkable and presently not fully understood ``paradox of youth.'' What is known about the emission properties of the accreting gas onto Sgr  A* is also summarized and how this emission is beginning to delineate the physical properties in the hot accretion zone around the event horizon.},

	Abstract = {Aims:The centre of the Milky Way is the nearest nucleus of a galaxy and offers a unique possibility to study the structure and dynamics of a dense stellar cluster around a super-massive black hole.  Methods: We present high-resolution seeing limited and AO NIR imaging observations of the stellar cluster within about one parsec of Sgr A*, the massive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. Stellar number counts and the diffuse background light density were extracted from these observations in order to examine the structure of the nuclear stellar cluster. A detailed map of the variation of interstellar extinction in the central ~0.5 pc of the Milky Way is presented and used to correct the stellar number counts and diffuse light density.  Results: Our findings are as follows: (a) a broken-power law provides an excellent fit to the overall structure of the GC nuclear cluster. The power-law slope of the cusp is Gamma = 0.19 $\pm$ 0.05, the break radius is R_break = 6.0'' $\pm$ 1.0'' or 0.22 $\pm$ 0.04 pc, and the cluster density decreases with a power-law index of Gamma = 0.75 $\pm$ 0.1 outside of R_break. (b) Using the best velocity dispersion measurements from the literature, we derive higher mass estimates for the central parsec than assumed until now. The inferred density of the cluster at the break radius is 2.8 $\pm$ 1.3×106 M&sun; pc-3. This high density agrees well with the small extent and flat slope of the cusp. Possibly, the mass of the stars makes up only about 50% of the total cluster mass. (c) Possible indications of mass segregation in the cusp are found (d) The cluster appears not entirely homogeneous. Several density clumps are detected that are concentrated at projected distances of R = 3'' and R = 7'' from Sgr A*. (e) There appears to exist an under-density of horizontal branch/red clump stars near R = 5'', or an over-density of stars of similar brightness at R = 3'' and R = 7''. (f) The extinction map in combination with cometary-like features in an L'-band image may provide support for the assumption of an outflow from Sgr A*.},

	Abstract = {Context: The GC is the closest galactic nucleus, offering the unique possibility of studying the population of a dense stellar cluster surrounding an SMBH.  Aims: The goals of this work are to develop a new method of separating early and late type stellar components of a dense stellar cluster based on narrow band filters, applying it to the central parsec of the GC, and conducting a population analysis of this area. Methods: We use AO assisted observations obtained at the ESO VLT in the NIR H-band and 7 intermediate bands covering the NIR K-band. A comparison of the resulting SEDs with a blackbody of variable extinction then allows us to determine the presence and strength of a CO absorption feature to distinguish between early and late type stars. Results: This new method is suitable for classifying K giants (and later), as well as B2 main sequence (and earlier) stars that are brighter than 15.5 mag in the K band in the central parsec. Compared to previous spectroscopic investigations that are limited to 13-14 mag, this represents a major improvement in the depth of the observations and reduces the needed observation time. Extremely red objects and foreground sources can also be reliably removed from the sample. Comparison to sources of known classification indicates that the method has an accuracy of better than ~87%. We classify 312 stars as early type candidates out of a sample of 5914 sources. Several results, such as the shape of the KLF and the spatial distribution of both early and late type stars, confirm and extend previous works. The distribution of the early type stars can be fitted with a steep power law (beta1'' = -1.49 $\pm$ 0.12), alternatively with a broken power law, beta1-10'' = -1.08 $\pm$ 0.12, beta10-20'' = -3.46 $\pm$ 0.58, since we find a drop in the early type density at ~10''. We also detect early type candidates outside of 0.5 pc in significant numbers for the first time. The late type density function shows an inversion in the inner 6'', with a power-law slope of betaR<6'' = 0.17 $\pm$ 0.09. The late type KLF has a power-law slope of 0.30 $\pm$ 0.01, closely resembling the KLF obtained for the bulge of the Milky Way. The early type KLF has a much flatter slope of (0.14 $\pm$ 0.02). Our results agree best with an in-situ star formation scenario.

	Abstract = {We present new observations of the nuclear star cluster in the central parsec of the Galaxy with the adaptive optics assisted, integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the ESO/VLT. Our work allows the spectroscopic detection of early- and late-type stars to mK >= 16, more than 2 mag deeper than our previous data sets. Our observations result in a total sample of 177 bona fide early-type stars. We find that most of these Wolf Rayet (WR), O-, and B-stars reside in two strongly warped disks between 0farcs8 and 12'' from Sgr A*, as well as a central compact concentration (the S-star cluster) centered on Sgr A*. The later type B-stars (mK >15) in the radial interval between 0farcs8 and 12'' seem to be in a more isotropic distribution outside the disks. The observed dearth of late-type stars in the central few arcseconds is puzzling, even when allowing for stellar collisions. The stellar mass function of the disk stars is extremely top heavy with a best-fit power law of dN/dm vprop m -0.45$\pm$ 0.3. WR/O-stars were formed in situ in a single star formation event ~6 Myr ago, this mass function probably reflects the initial mass function (IMF). The mass functions of the S-stars inside 0farcs8 and of the early-type stars at distances beyond 12'' are compatible with a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF (best-fit power law of dN/dm vprop m -2.15$\pm$ 0.3).

@article{Gallego-Cano:2018uk,
	Abstract = {Context. The existence of dynamically relaxed stellar density cusps in dense clusters around massive black holes is a long-standing prediction of stellar dynamics, but it has so far escaped unambiguous observational confirmation.  Aims: In this paper we aim to revisit the problem of inferring the innermost structure of the Milky Way's nuclear star cluster via star counts, to clarify whether it displays a core or a cusp around the central black hole.  Methods: We used judiciously selected adaptive optics assisted high angular resolution images obtained with the NACO instrument at the ESO VLT. Through image stacking and improved point spread function fitting we pushed the completeness limit about one magnitude deeper than in previous, comparable work. Crowding and extinction corrections were derived and applied to the surface density estimates. Known young, and therefore dynamically not relaxed stars, are excluded from the analysis. Contrary to previous work, we analyse the stellar density in well-defined magnitude ranges in order to be able to constrain stellar masses and ages.  Results: We focus on giant stars, with observed magnitudes K = 12.5-16, and on stars with observed magnitudes K ≈ 18, which may have similar mean ages and masses than the former. The giants display a core-like surface density profile within a projected radius R <= 0.3 pc of the central black hole, in agreement with previous studies, but their 3D density distribution is not inconsistent with a shallow cusp if we take into account the extent of the entire cluster, beyond the radius of influence of the central black hole. The surface density of the fainter stars can be described well by a single power-law at R < 2 pc. The cusp-like profile of the faint stars persists even if we take into account the possible contamination of stars in this brightness range by young pre-main sequence stars. The data are inconsistent with a core-profile for the faint stars. Finally, we show that a 3D Nuker law provides a good description of the cluster structure.  Conclusions: We conclude that the observed density of the faintest stars detectable with reasonable completeness at the Galactic centre, is consistent with the existence of a stellar cusp around the Milky Way's central black hole, Sagittarius A*. This cusp is well developed inside the influence radius of Sagittarius A* and can be described by a single three-dimensional power-law with an exponent gamma = 1.43 $\pm$ 0.02 $\pm$ 0.1sys. This corroborates existing conclusions from Nbody simulations performed in a companion paper. An important caveat is that the faint stars analysed here may be contaminated significantly by dynamically unrelaxed stars that formed about 100 Myr ago. The apparent lack of giants at projected distances of R ≲ 0.3 pc (R ≲ 8'') of the massive black hole may indicate that some mechanism may have altered their distribution or intrinsic luminosity. We roughly estimate the number of possibly missing giants to about 100.  19 additional tables are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (http://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/609/A26},

	Abstract = {Context. This is the second of three papers that search for the predicted stellar cusp around the Milky Way's central black hole, Sagittarius A*, with new data and methods.  Aims: We aim to infer the distribution of the faintest stellar population currently accessible through observations around Sagittarius A*.  Methods: We used adaptive optics assisted high angular resolution images obtained with the NACO instrument at the ESO VLT. Through optimised PSF fitting we removed the light from all detected stars above a given magnitude limit. Subsequently we analysed the remaining, diffuse light density. Systematic uncertainties were constrained by the use of data from different observing epochs and obtained with different filters. We show that it is necessary to correct for the diffuse emission from the mini-spiral, which would otherwise lead to a systematically biased light density profile. We used a Paschen alpha map obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope for this purpose.  Results: The azimuthally averaged diffuse surface light density profile within a projected distance of R ≲ 0.5 pc from Sagittarius A* can be described consistently by a single power law with an exponent of Gamma = 0.26 $\pm$ 0.02stat $\pm$ 0.05sys, similar to what has been found for the surface number density of faint stars in Paper I.  Conclusions: The analysed diffuse light arises from sub-giant and main-sequence stars with Ks ≈ 19-22 with masses of 0.8-1.5 M&sun;. These stars can be old enough to be dynamically relaxed. The observed power-law profile and its slope are consistent with the existence of a relaxed stellar cusp around the Milky Way's central black hole. We find that a Nuker law provides an adequate description of the nuclear cluster's intrinsic shape (assuming spherical symmetry). The 3D power-law slope near Sgr A* is gamma = 1.13 $\pm$ 0.03model $\pm$ 0.05sys. The stellar density decreases more steeply beyond a break radius of about 3 pc, which corresponds roughly to the radius of influence of the massive black hole. At a distance of 0.01 pc from the black hole, we estimate a stellar mass density of 2.6 $\pm$ 0.3 × 107 M&sun; pc-3 and a total enclosed stellar mass of 180 $\pm$ 30 M&sun;. These estimates assume a constant mass-to-light ratio and do not take stellar remnants into account. The fact that a flat projected surface density is observed for old giants at projected distances R ≲ 0.3 pc implies that some mechanism may have altered their appearance or distribution.},

	Abstract = {Axisymmetric models of the Milky Way exhibit strong interrelations between the Galactic constants [the Sun's distance to the Galactic Centre (R0), and the local rotation speed (theta0)], the local stellar column density [Sigma*(R0)] and the shortest-to-longest axis ratio of the dark matter halo (q). In this paper we present simple analytical approximations that allow for an efficient search through the vastness of parameter space, and apply this approximation to investigate the consequences of the uncertain gaseous velocity dispersion (sigmag) on the constraints imposed by the thickness of the Milky Way's gas layer. The extra degree of freedom does not significantly alter the conclusions drawn in a previous paper on the shape of the Milky Way's dark matter halo. A significant contribution to the total gas pressure by cosmic rays and magnetic fields beyond the optical disc is thus ruled out. We find that the Milky Way's dark halo is close to spherical if R0>~7.1kpc, while a significantly flattened dark matter halo is possible only if our distance to the Galactic Centre is smaller than ~6.8kpc. Thus, if R0 is larger than ~7kpc, or theta0>~170kms-1, we can rule out two dark matter candidates that require a highly flattened dark matter halo: (1) decaying massive neutrinos, and (2) a disc of cold molecular hydrogen. It is possible to construct a self-consistent axisymmetric model of the Galaxy based on the IAU-recommended values for the Galactic constants (R0=8.5kpc, theta0=220kms-1) only in the unlikely case that the effective gaseous velocity dispersion is ~19 per cent larger than observed, and if the local stellar column density is less than about 18Msolarpc-2. If we assume that the halo is oblate and a value of Sigma* of 35+/-5Msolarpc-2, we can rule out Galactic models with R0>~8.0kpc and theta0>~200kms-1. Combining the best kinematical and star-count estimates of Sigma*, we conclude that Sigma* probably lies between 25 and 45Msolarpc-2. We find that Kuijken & Gilmore's determination of the column density of matter within 1.1kpc of the plane is robust and valid over a wide range of Galactic constants. Our mass models show that, largely owing to the uncertainty in the Galactic light distribution, the dark matter density in the Galactic Centre is uncertain by up to three orders of magnitude. In the solar neighbourhood this uncertainty is much reduced: our models imply a dark matter density of some 0.42GeV/c2 per cubic centimetre, or (11+/-5)mMsolarpc-3 - roughly 15 per cent of the total mass density.},

@article{Olling:2000rp,
	Abstract = {In order to test the reliability of determinations of the shapes of dark-matter haloes of the galaxies, we have made such measurements for the Milky Way by two independent methods. First, we have combined the measurements of the overall mass distribution of the Milky Way derived from its rotation curve and the measurements of the amount of dark matter in the solar neighbourhood obtained from stellar kinematics to determine the flattening of the dark halo. Secondly, we have used the established technique based on the variation in thickness of the Milky Way's Hi layer with radius: by assuming that the Hi gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the gravitational potential of a galaxy, one can use the observed flaring of the gas layer to determine the shape of the dark halo. These techniques are found to produce a consistent estimate for the flattening of the dark-matter halo, with a shortest-to-longest axis ratio of q~0.8, but only if one adopts somewhat non-standard values for the distance to the Galactic centre, R0, and the local Galactic rotation speed, Theta0. For consistency, one requires values of R0<~7.6kpc and Theta0<~190kms-1. The results depend on the Galactic constants because the adopted values affect both distance measurements within the Milky Way and the shape of the rotation curve, which, in turn, alter the inferred halo shape. Although differing significantly from the current IAU-sanctioned values, these upper limits are consistent with all existing observational constraints. If future measurements confirm these lower values for the Galactic constants, then the validity of the gas-layer-flaring method will be confirmed. Further, dark-matter candidates such as cold molecular gas and massive decaying neutrinos, which predict very flat dark haloes with q<~0.2, will be ruled out. Conversely, if the Galactic constants were found to be close to the more conventional values, then there would have to be some systematic error in the methods for measuring dark halo shapes, so the existing modelling techniques would have to be viewed with some scepticism.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of solar-mass stars around a massive black hole in a globular star cluster is investigated using a basic physical picture in which stars in bound orbits in the gravitational potential well of the black hole diffuse from one bound orbit to another via star-star gravitational scattering. Detailed expressions are derived for the relevant diffusion coefficients, the time-dependent Boltzmann equation is solved numerically, and solutions are found which satisfy the boundary conditions at both zero and large binding energy. The results indicate that the distribution function is approximately a power law throughout most of the black hole's gravitational well, that stars in bound orbits diffuse slowly down the gravitational well under equilibrium conditions, and that a black hole of less than or approximately 1000 solar masses may accrete stars primarily by capture from unbound orbits. Several methods for detecting massive black holes in cores of globular clusters are discussed along with expected large statistical fluctuations close to the black hole and the possible relevance of various stellar accretion processes for globular-cluster X-ray sources.},

	Abstract = {If a class of stars orbits the central black hole in our galaxy in short-period (~0.1 yr), high-eccentricity (~0.9) orbits, they will experience precessions of their orbital planes induced by both relativistic frame dragging and the quadrupolar gravity of the hole, at levels that could be as large as 10 muas per year, if the black hole is rotating faster than half of its maximum rotation rate. Astrometric observations of the orbits of at least two such stars can in principle lead to a determination of the angular momentum vector \boldsymbol{J} of the black hole and its quadrupole moment Q2. This could lead to a test of the general relativistic no-hair theorems, which demand that Q2 = - J2/M. Future high-precision adaptive infrared optics instruments may make such a fundamental test of the black hole paradigm possible.},

	Abstract = {We discuss physical experiments achievable via the monitoring of stellar dynamics near the massive black hole at the Galactic center with a diffraction-limited, next-generation, extremely large telescope (ELT). Given the likely observational capabilities of an ELT and what is currently known about the stellar environment at the Galactic center, we synthesize plausible samples of stellar orbits around the black hole. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to evaluate the constraints that the monitoring of these orbits will place on the matter content within the dynamical sphere of influence of the black hole. We express our results as functions of the number N of stars with detectable orbital motions and the astrometric precision deltatheta and spectroscopic precision deltav at which the stellar proper motions and radial velocities are monitored. Our results are easily scaled to different telescope sizes and precisions. For N=100, deltatheta=0.5mas, and deltav=10kms-1 (a conservative estimate of the capabilities of a 30 m telescope) we find that if the extended matter distribution enclosed by the orbits at 0.01 pc has a mass greater than ~103 Msolar, it will produce measurable deviations from Keplerian motion. Thus, if the concentration of dark matter at the Galactic center matches theoretical predictions, its influence on the orbits will be detectable. We also estimate the constraints that will be placed on the mass of the black hole and on the distance to the Galactic center and find that both will be measured to better than ~0.1%. We discuss the significance of knowing the distance to within a few parsecs and the importance of this parameter for understanding the structure of the Galaxy. We demonstrate that the lowest order relativistic effects, such as the prograde precession, will be detectable if deltatheta<~0.5mas. Barring the favorable discovery of a star on a highly compact, eccentric orbit, the higher order effects, including the frame dragging due to the spin of the black hole, will require deltatheta<~0.05mas. Finally, we calculate the rate at which monitored stars experience detectable nearby encounters with background stars. The encounters probe the mass function of stellar remnants that accumulate near the black hole. We find that ~30 such encounters will be detected over a 10 yr baseline for deltatheta=0.5mas.},

@article{Rubilar:2001zp,
	Abstract = {The presence of a 2.9+/-0.4 million solar mass object in the central stellar cluster of the Milky Way has recently been demonstrated via measurements of the stellar proper motions and radial velocities. This mass is located at the position of the compact radio source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) at a distance of Ro=8.0 kpc and is most likely present in the form of a massive black hole (BH). Some of the stars have a projected distance to Sgr A* of <=0.005 pc and have proper motion velocities of up to 1400 km s-1. Recent measurements indicate that their orbits show significant curvatures indicating that the stars indeed orbit the central compact object. Detailed measurements of the stellar orbits close to Sgr A* will allow us to precisely determine the distribution of this mass. With an increased point source sensitivity due to the combination of large telescope apertures, adaptive optics, and - in the very near future - NIR interferometry it is likely that stars with orbital time scales of the order of one year will be detected. Theses sources, however, will most likely not be on simple Keplerian orbits. The effects of measurable prograde relativistic and retrograde Newtonian periastron shifts will result in rosetta shaped orbits. A substantial Newtonian periastron rotation can already be expected if only a few percent of the central mass are extended. We discuss the conditions under which an extended mass can (over-) compensate the relativistic periastron shift. We also demonstrate that measuring a single periastron shift is not sufficient to determine the distribution of an extended mass component. A periastron shift will allow us to determine the inclination of the stellar orbits and to derive inclination corrected shift values. These have to be acquired for three stars on orbits with different energy or angular momentum in order to unambiguously solve for the compactness, extent and shape of any extended mass contribution.},

@article{Ghez:2008tg,
	Abstract = {We report new precision measurements of the properties of our Galaxy's supermassive black hole. Based on astrometric (1995-2007) and radial velocity (RV; 2000-2007) measurements from the W. M. Keck 10 m telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short-period star S0-2 provides values for the distance (R0) of 8.0 +/- 0.6 kpc, the enclosed mass (Mbh) of 4.1 +/- 0.6 × 106 M&sun;, and the black hole's RV, which is consistent with zero with 30 km s-1 uncertainty. If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e.g., has no massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit, obtaining R0 = 8.4 +/- 0.4 kpc and Mbh = 4.5 +/- 0.4 × 106 M&sun;. More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3-4 × 105 M&sun; within 0.01 pc, ~100 times higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion (up to 5 times the astrometric error) and the assumptions regarding the black hole's radial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy and the usefulness of fainter stars. Future astrometric and RV observations will remedy these effects. Our estimates of R0 and the Galaxy's local rotation speed, which it is derived from combining R0 with the apparent proper motion of Sgr A*, (theta0 = 229 +/- 18 km s-1), are compatible with measurements made using other methods. The increased black hole mass found in this study, compared to that determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period for the innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars in the vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the Mbh-sigma relation.},

	Abstract = {Using 25 years of data from uninterrupted monitoring of stellar orbits in the Galactic Center, we present an update of the main results from this unique data set: a measurement of mass and distance to Sgr A*. Our progress is not only due to the eight-year increase in time base, but also to the improved definition of the coordinate system. The star S2 continues to yield the best constraints on the mass of and distance to Sgr A* the statistical errors of 0.13× {10}6 {M}&sun;  and 0.12  kpc have halved compared to the previous study. The S2 orbit fit is robust and does not need any prior information. Using coordinate system priors, the star S1 also yields tight constraints on mass and distance. For a combined orbit fit, we use 17 stars, which yields our current best estimates for mass and distance: M=4.28+/- 0.10{| }{stat.}+/- 0.21{| }{sys}× {10}6 {M}&sun;  and {R}0=8.32+/- 0.07{| }{stat.}+/- 0.14{| }{sys} {kpc}. These numbers are in agreement with the recent determination of R 0 from the statistical cluster parallax. The positions of the mass, of the near-infrared flares from Sgr A*, and of the radio source Sgr A* agree to within 1 mas. In total, we have determined orbits for 40 stars so far, a sample which consists of 32 stars with randomly oriented orbits and a thermal eccentricity distribution, plus eight stars that we can explicitly show are members of the clockwise disk of young stars, and which have lower-eccentricity orbits.},

	Abstract = {With 10 years of high-resolution imaging data now available on the stellar cluster in the Galactic center, we present proper motions for more than 40 stars at projected distances <=1.2" from Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We find evidence on a >=2 sigma level for radial anisotropy of the cluster of stars within 1" of Sgr A*. For a brightness limit of K~15.5, we find no evidence for a stationary source at the position of Sgr A* or for a source at this position that would be variable on a timescale of at least several hours to days. On timescales of seconds to tens of minutes, we find no variability at the Sgr A* position on brightness levels K<=13.5. We confirm/find accelerated motion for six stars, with four stars having passed the pericenter of their orbits during the observed time span. We calculated/constrained the orbital parameters of these stars. All orbits have moderate to high eccentricities. We discuss the possible bias in detecting preferentially orbits with high eccentricities and find that measured values of e>0.9 might be detected by about a factor of 1.5-2 more frequently. We find that the center of acceleration for all the orbits coincides with the radio position of Sgr A*. From the orbit of the star S2, the currently most tightly constrained one, we determine the mass of Sgr A* to be (3.3+/-0.7)×106 Msolar and its position to 2.0+/-2.4 mas east and 2.7+/-4.5 mas south of the nominal radio position. The mass estimate for the central dark mass from the orbit of S2 is fully consistent with the mass estimate of (3.4+/-0.5)×106 Msolar obtained from stellar proper motions within 1.2" of Sgr A* using a Leonard-Merritt mass estimator. We find that radio astronomical observations of the proper motion of Sgr A*, in combination with its intrinsic source size, place at the moment the tightest constraints on the mass density of Sgr A*, which must exceed rhoSgrA*>3×1019 Msolar pc-3.

	Abstract = {Many galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centres-more than a million times the mass of the Sun. Measurements of stellar velocities and the discovery of variable X-ray emission have provided strong evidence in favour of such a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, but have hitherto been unable to rule out conclusively the presence of alternative concentrations of mass. Here we report ten years of high-resolution astrometric imaging that allows us to trace two-thirds of the orbit of the star currently closest to the compact radio source (and massive black-hole candidate) Sagittarius A*. The observations, which include both pericentre and apocentre passages, show that the star is on a bound, highly elliptical keplerian orbit around Sgr A*, with an orbital period of 15.2 years and a pericentre distance of only 17 light hours. The orbit with the best fit to the observations requires a central point mass of (3.7 +/- 1.5) × 106 solar masses (M). The data no longer allow for a central mass composed of a dense cluster of dark stellar objects or a ball of massive, degenerate fermions.},

	Abstract = {Two recent papers (Ghez et al. 2008; Gillessen et al. 2009) have estimated the mass of and the distance to the massive black hole (MBH) in the center of the Milky Way using stellar orbits. The two astrometric data sets are independent and yielded consistent results, even though the measured positions do not match when simply overplotting the two sets. In this Letter, we show that the two sets can be brought to excellent agreement with each other when we allow for a small offset in the definition of the reference frame of the two data sets. The required offsets in the coordinates and velocities of the origin of the reference frames are consistent with the uncertainties given in Ghez et al. The so-combined data set allows for a moderate improvement of the statistical errors of the mass of and the distance to Sgr A*, but the overall accuracies of these numbers are dominated by systematic errors and the long-term calibration of the reference frame. We obtain R 0 = 8.28 $\pm$ 0.15|stat $\pm$ 0.29|sys kpc and M MBH = 4.30 $\pm$ 0.20|stat $\pm$ 0.30|sys × 106 M sun as best estimates from a multi-star fit.},

	Abstract = {We present the first laser guide star adaptive optics (LGSAO) observations of the Galactic center. LGSAO has dramatically improved the quality and robustness with which high angular resolution infrared images of the Galactic center can be obtained with the Keck II 10 m telescope. Specifically, Strehl ratios of 0.7 and 0.3 at L' (3.8 mum) and K' (2.1 mum), respectively, are achieved in these LGSAO images; these are at least a factor of 2 higher and a factor of 4-5 more stable against atmospheric fluctuations than the Strehl ratios delivered thus far with the Keck natural guide star AO system on the Galactic center. Furthermore, these observations are the first that cover a large area (76''×76'') surrounding the central black hole at diffraction-limited resolution for an 8-10 m class telescope. During our observations, the infrared counterpart to the central supermassive black hole, Sgr A*-IR, showed significant infrared intensity variations, with observed L' magnitudes ranging from 12.6 to 14.5 mag and a decrease in flux density of a factor of 2 over an 8 minute interval. The faintest end of our L' detections, 1.3 mJy (dereddened), is the lowest level of emission yet observed for this source by a factor of 3. No significant variation in the location of Sgr A*-IR is detected as a function of either wavelength or intensity. Previous claims of such positional variations are easily attributable to a nearby (0.09" or 720 AU, projected), extended, very red source, which we suggest arises from a locally heated dust feature. Near a peak in its intensity, we obtained the first measurement of Sgr A*-IR's K'-L' color; its K'-L' of 3.0+/-0.2 mag (observed) or 1.4+/-0.2 (dereddened) corresponds to an intrinsic spectral index of alpha=-0.5+/-0.3 for Fnu~nualpha. This is significantly bluer than other recent infrared measurements from the literature, which suggest alpha=-4+/-1. Because our measurement was taken at a time when Sgr A* was ~6 times brighter in the infrared than the other measurements, we posit that the spectral index of the emission arising from the vicinity of our Galaxy's central black hole may depend on the strength of the flare, with stronger flares giving rise to a higher fraction of high-energy electrons in the emitting region.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained the first detection of spectral absorption lines in one of the high-velocity stars in the vicinity of the Galaxy's central supermassive black hole. Both Brgamma (2.1661 mum) and He I (2.1126 mum) are seen in absorption in S0-2 with equivalent widths (2.8+/-0.3 and 1.7+/-0.4 {\AA}) and an inferred stellar rotational velocity (220+/-40 km s-1) that are consistent with that of an O8-B0 dwarf, which suggests that it is a massive (~15 Msolar) young (less than 10 Myr) main-sequence star. This presents a major challenge to star formation theories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail over all distances reached by S0-2 in its current orbit (130-1900 AU) and the difficulty in migrating this star inward during its lifetime from farther out where tidal forces should no longer preclude star formation. The radial velocity measurements (z>=-510+/-40 km s-1) and our reported proper motions for S0-2 strongly constrain its orbit, providing a direct measure of the black hole mass of 4.1(+/-0.6)×106(R0/8 kpc)3 Msolar. The Keplerian orbit parameters have uncertainties that are reduced by a factor of 2-3 compared to previously reported values and include, for the first time, an independent solution for the dynamical center; this location, while consistent with the nominal infrared position of Sgr A*, is localized to a factor of 5 more precisely (+/-2 mas). Furthermore, the ambiguity in the inclination of the orbit is resolved with the addition of the radial velocity measurement, indicating that the star is behind the black hole at the time of closest approach and counterrevolving against the Galaxy. With further radial velocity measurements in the next few years, the orbit of S0-2 will provide the most robust estimate of the distance to the Galactic center.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that short-period stars orbiting around the supermassive black hole in our Galactic center can successfully be used to probe the gravitational theory in a strong regime. We use 19 years of observations of the two best measured short-period stars orbiting our Galactic center to constrain a hypothetical fifth force that arises in various scenarios motivated by the development of a unification theory or in some models of dark matter and dark energy. No deviation from general relativity is reported and the fifth force strength is restricted to an upper 95% confidence limit of |alpha | <0.016 at a length scale of lambda =150 astronomical units. We also derive a 95% confidence upper limit on a linear drift of the argument of periastron of the short-period star S0-2 of |omega˙ S0-2| <1.6 ×10-3 rad /yr , which can be used to constrain various gravitational and astrophysical theories. This analysis provides the first fully self-consistent test of the gravitational theory using orbital dynamic in a strong gravitational regime, that of a supermassive black hole. A sensitivity analysis for future measurements is also presented.},

@article{Grould:2017zl,
	Abstract = {Context. The first observations of the GRAVITY instrument obtained in 2016, have shown that it should become possible to probe the spacetime close to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) at the Galactic center by using accurate astrometric positions of the S2 star.  Aims: The goal of this paper is to investigate the detection by GRAVITY of different relativistic effects affecting the astrometric and/or spectroscopic observations of S2 such as the transverse Doppler shift, the gravitational redshift, the pericenter advance and higher-order general relativistic (GR) effects, in particular the Lense-Thirring effect due to the angular momentum of the black hole.  Methods: We implement seven stellar-orbit models to simulate both astrometric and spectroscopic observations of S2 beginning near its next pericenter passage in 2018. Each model takes into account a certain number of relativistic effects. The most accurate one is a fully GR model and is used to generate the mock observations of the star. For each of the six other models, we determine the minimal observation times above which it fails to fit the observations, showing the effects that should be detected. These threshold times are obtained for different astrometric accuracies as well as for different spectroscopic errors.  Results: Transverse Doppler shift and gravitational redshift can be detected within a few months by using S2 observations obtained with pairs of accuracies (sigmaA,sigmaV) = (10-100 muas, 1-10 km s-1) where sigmaA and sigmaV are the astrometric and spectroscopic accuracies, respectively. Gravitational lensing can be detected within a few years with (sigmaA,sigmaV) = (10 muas, 10 km s-1). Pericenter advance should be detected within a few years with (sigmaA,sigmaV) = (10 muas, 1-10 km s-1). Cumulative high-order photon curvature contributions, including the Shapiro time delay, affecting spectroscopic measurements can be observed within a few months with (sigmaA,sigmaV) = (10 muas, 1 km s-1). By using a stellar-orbit model neglecting relativistic effects on the photon path except the major contribution of gravitational lensing, S2 observations obtained with accuracies (sigmaA,sigmaV) = (10 muas, 10 km s-1), and a black hole angular momentum (a,i',Omega') = (0.99,45$\,^{\circ}$,160$\,^{\circ}$), the 1sigma error on the spin parameter a is of about 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 for a total observing run of 16, 30, and 47 yr, respectively. The 1sigma errors on the direction of the angular momentum reach sigmai' ≈ 25$\,^{\circ}$ and sigmaOmega' ≈ 40$\,^{\circ}$ when considering the three orbital periods run. We found that the uncertainties obtained with a less spinning black hole (a = 0.7) are similar to those evaluated with a = 0.99.  Conclusions: The combination of S2 observations obtained with the GRAVITY instrument and the spectrograph SINFONI (Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observations in the Near Infrared) also installed at the VLT (Very Large Telescope) will lead to the detection of various relativistic effects. Such detections will be possible with S2 monitorings obtained within a few months or years, depending on the effect. Strong constraints on the angular momentum of Sgr A* (e.g., at 1sigma = 0.1) with the S2 star will be possible with a simple stellar-orbit model without using a ray-tracing code but with approximating the gravitational lensing effect. However, long monitorings are necessary, and we thus must rely on the discovery of closer-in stars near Sgr A* if we want to efficiently constrain the black hole parameters with stellar orbits in a short time, or monitor the flares if they orbit around the black hole.},

	Abstract = {We analyze and report in detail new near-infrared (1.45-2.45 mum) observations of the Dusty S-cluster Object (DSO/G2) during its approach to the black hole at the center of the Galaxy that were carried out with the ESO Very Large Telescope/SINFONI between 2014 February and September. Before 2014 May we detect spatially compact Brgamma and Paalpha line emission from the DSO at about 40 mas east of Sgr A*. The velocity of the source, measured from the redshifted emission, is 2700 $\pm$ 60 km s-1. No blueshifted emission above the noise level is detected at the position of Sgr A* or upstream of the presumed orbit. After May we find spatially compact Brgamma blueshifted line emission from the DSO at about 30 mas west of Sgr A* at a velocity of -3320 $\pm$ 60 km s-1 and no indication for significant redshifted emission. We do not detect any significant extension of the velocity gradient across the source. We find a Brgamma line FWHM of 50 $\pm$ 10 {\AA} before and 15 $\pm$ 10 {\AA} after the peribothron transit, i.e., no significant line broadening with respect to last year is observed. Brgamma line maps show that the bulk of the line emission originates from a region of less than 20 mas diameter. This is consistent with a very compact source on an elliptical orbit with a peribothron time passage in 2014.39 $\pm$ 0.14. For the moment, the flaring activity of the black hole in the near-infrared regime has not shown any statistically significant increment. Increased accretion activity of Sgr A* may still be upcoming. We discuss details of a source model according to which the DSO is a young accreting star rather than a coreless gas and dust cloud.},

	Abstract = {The source G2 has already completed its pericentre passage around Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the centre of our Galaxy. Although it has been monitored for 15 yr, its astrophysical nature and origin still remain unknown. In this work, we aim to test the hypothesis of G2 being the result of a stellar wind collision. To do so, we study the motion and final fate of gas clumps formed as a result of collisions of stellar winds in massive binaries. Our approach is based on a test-particle model in order to describe the trajectories of such clumps. The model takes into account the gravitational field of Sgr A*, the interaction of the clumps with the interstellar medium as well as their finite lifetimes. Our analysis allows us to reject the hypothesis based on four arguments: (i) if G2 has followed a purely Keplerian orbit since its formation, it cannot have been produced in any of the known massive binaries since their motions are not consistent, (ii) in general, gas clumps are evaporated through thermal conduction on very short timescale (<100 yr) before getting close enough to Sgr A*, (iii) IRS 16SW, the best candidate for the origin of G2, cannot generate clumps as massive as G2, and (iv) clumps ejected from IRS 16SW describe trajectories significantly different to the observed motion of G2.},

	Abstract = {We present new adaptive optics (AO) imaging and spectroscopic measurements of Galactic center source G1 from W. M. Keck Observatory. Our goal is to understand its nature and relationship to G2, which is the first example of a spatially resolved object interacting with a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Both objects have been monitored with AO for the past decade (2003-2014) and are comparatively close to the black hole (a min ˜ 200-300 au) on very eccentric orbits (e G1 ˜ 0.99 e G2 ˜ 0.96). While G2 has been tracked before and during periapsis passage (T 0 ˜ 2014.2), G1 has been followed since soon after emerging from periapsis (T 0 ˜ 2001.3). Our observations of G1 double the previously reported observational time baseline, which improves its orbital parameter determinations. G1's orbital trajectory appears to be in the same plane as that of G2 but with a significantly different argument of periapsis (Deltaomega = 21$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 4$\,^{\circ}$). This suggests that G1 is an independent object and not part of a gas stream containing G2, as has been proposed. Furthermore, we show for the first time that (1) G1 is extended in the epochs closest to periapsis along the direction of orbital motion, and (2) it becomes significantly smaller over time (450 au in 2004 to less than 170 au in 2009). Based on these observations, G1 appears to be the second example of an object tidally interacting with an SMBH. G1's existence 14 yr after periapsis, along with its compactness in epochs further from the time of periapsis, suggest that this source is stellar in nature.},

	Abstract = {The population of young stars near the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic Center (GC) has presented an unexpected challenge to theories of star formation. Kinematic measurements of these stars have revealed a stellar disk structure (with an apparent 20% disk membership) that has provided important clues regarding the origin of these mysterious young stars. However, many of the apparent disk properties are difficult to explain, including the low disk membership fraction and the high eccentricities given the youth of this population. Thus far, all efforts to derive the properties of this disk have made the simplifying assumption that stars at the GC are single stars. Nevertheless, stellar binaries are prevalent in our Galaxy, and recent investigations suggested that they may also be abundant in the Galactic Center. Here, we show that binaries in the disk can largely alter the apparent orbital properties of the disk. The motion of binary members around each other adds a velocity component, which can be comparable to the magnitude of the velocity around the SMBH in the GC. Thus, neglecting the contribution of binaries can significantly vary the inferred stars' orbital properties. While the disk orientation is unaffected, the apparent disk's 2D width will be increased to about 11.$\,^{\circ}$2, similar to the observed width. For a population of stars orbiting the SMBH with zero eccentricity, unaccounted for binaries will create a wide apparent eccentricity distribution with an average of 0.23. This is consistent with the observed average eccentricity of the stars' in the disk. We suggest that this high eccentricity value, which poses a theoretical challenge, may be an artifact of binary stars. Finally, our results suggest that the actual disk membership might be significantly higher than the one inferred by observations that ignore the contribution of binaries, alleviating another theoretical challenge.},

	Abstract = {We report new observations of the Galactic Center source G2 from the W. M. Keck Observatory. G2 is a dusty red object associated with gas that shows tidal interactions as it nears its closest approach with the Galaxy's central black hole. Our observations, conducted as G2 passed through periapse, were designed to test the proposal that G2 is a 3 Earth mass gas cloud. Such a cloud should be tidally disrupted during periapse passage. The data were obtained using the Keck II laser guide star adaptive optics system (LGSAO) and the facility near-infrared camera (NIRC2) through the K' [2.1 mum] and L' [3.8 mum] broadband filters. Several results emerge from these observations: (1) G2 has survived its closest approach to the black hole as a compact, unresolved source at L', (2) G2's L' brightness measurements are consistent with those over the last decade, (3) G2's motion continues to be consistent with a Keplerian model. These results rule out G2 as a pure gas cloud and imply that G2 has a central star. This star has a luminosity of ~30 L &sun; and is surrounded by a large (~2.6 AU) optically thick dust shell. The differences between the L' and Br-gamma observations can be understood with a model in which L' and Br-gamma emission arises primarily from internal and external heating, respectively. We suggest that G2 is a binary star merger product and will ultimately appear similar to the B-stars that are tightly clustered around the black hole (the so-called S-star cluster).},

	Abstract = {We present adaptive-optics assisted near-infrared high-spectral-resolution observations of late-type giants in the nuclear star cluster of the Milky Way. The metallicity and elemental abundance measurements of these stars offer us an opportunity to understand the formation and evolution of the nuclear star cluster. In addition, their proximity to the supermassive black hole (˜0.5 pc) offers a unique probe of the star formation and chemical enrichment in this extreme environment. We observed two stars identified by medium spectral-resolution observations as potentially having very high metallicities. We use spectral-template fitting with the PHOENIX grid and Bayesian inference to simultaneously constrain the overall metallicity, [M/H], alpha-element abundance [alpha/Fe], effective temperature, and surface gravity of these stars. We find that one of the stars has very high metallicity ([M/H] > 0.6) and the other is slightly above solar metallicity. Both Galactic center stars have lines from scandium (Sc), vanadium (V), and yttrium (Y) that are much stronger than allowed by the PHOENIX grid. We find, using the spectral synthesis code Spectroscopy Made Easy, that [Sc/Fe] may be an order of magnitude above solar. For comparison, we also observed an empirical calibrator in NGC 6791, the highest metallicity cluster known ([M/H] ˜ 0.4). Most lines are well matched between the calibrator and the Galactic center stars, except for Sc, V, and Y, which confirms that their abundances must be anomalously high in these stars. These unusual abundances, which may be a unique signature of nuclear star clusters, offer an opportunity to test models of chemical enrichment in this region.},

	Abstract = {Knowing the metallicity distribution of stars in the Galactic Centre has important implications for the formation history of the Milky Way nuclear star cluster. However, this distribution is not well known, and is currently based on a small sample of fewer than 100 stars. We obtained near-infrared K-band spectra of more than 700 late-type stars in the central 4 pc2 of the Milky Way nuclear star cluster with the integral-field spectrograph KMOS (VLT). We analyse the medium-resolution spectra using a full-spectral fitting method employing the G{\"o}ttingen spectral library of synthetic PHOENIX spectra. The derived stellar metallicities range from metal-rich [M/H] > +0.3 dex to metal-poor [M/H] <-1.0 dex, with a fraction of 5.2^{+6.0}_{-3.1} per cent metal-poor ([M/H] <= -0.5 dex) stars. The metal-poor stars are distributed over the entire observed field. The origin of metal-poor stars remains unclear. They could originate from infalling globular clusters. For the metal-rich stellar population ([M/H] > 0 dex), a globular cluster origin can be ruled out. As there is only a very low fraction of metal-poor stars in the central 4 pc2 of the Galactic Centre, we believe that our data can discard a scenario in which the Milky Way nuclear star cluster is purely formed from infalling globular clusters.},

	Abstract = {The Galactic center offers us a unique opportunity to test General Relativity (GR) with the orbits of stars around a supermassive black hole. Observations of these stars have been one of the great successes of adaptive optics on 8-10 m telescopes, driving the need for the highest angular resolution and astrometric precision. New tests of gravitational physics in the strong gravity regime with stellar orbits will be made possible through the leap in angular resolution and sensitivity from the next generation of extremely large ground-based telescopes. We present new simulations of specific science cases such as the detection of the GR precession of stars, the measurement of extended dark mass, and the distance to the Galactic center. We use realistic models of the adaptive optics system for TMT and the IRIS instrument to simulate these science cases. In additions, the simulations include observational issues such as the impact of source confusion on astrometry and radial velocities in the dense environment of the Galactic center. We qualitatively show how improvements in sensitivity, astrometric and spectroscopic precision, and increasing the number of stars affect the science with orbits at the Galactic center. We developed a tool to determine the constraints on physical models using a joint fit of over 100 stars that are expected to be observable with TMT. These science cases require very high astrometric precision and stability, thus they provide some of the most stringent constraints on the planned instruments and adaptive optics systems.},

	Abstract = {We report on our work that analyzes in detail the astrometry performance of TMT's NFIRAOS/IRIS at our Galactic Center, where stars in orbit around the supermassive black hole are ideal probes of the curvature of space-time as predicted by General Relativity. This has the potential to test Einstein's theory in an unprecedented regime. The simulations fall into several distinct stages: first, a single-epoch set of simulated images of the Galactic Center (GC) is analyzed with respect to astrometric precision. Second, several epochs of observations are simulated taking into account the kinematic properties of the different stellar populations that exist in the GC. Third, the construction of an absolute reference frame is simulated, and the precision with which post-Newtonian effects in the orbits of short-period stars can be detected is determined. We use spatially variable points spread functions (PSF) that have been computed for the specific guide star constellation at the GC. Read-out and photon noise, thermal background as well as a model of the static distortion for the IRIS imager and the quadratic probe arm distortion are taken into account.},

	Abstract = {We present spatially resolved imaging and integral field spectroscopy data for 450 cool giant stars within 1 pc from Sgr A*. We use the prominent CO bandheads to derive effective temperatures of individual giants. Additionally we present the deepest spectroscopic observation of the Galactic center (GC) so far, probing the number of B9/A0 main-sequence stars (2.2-2.8 M sun) in two deep fields. From spectrophotometry we construct a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the red giant population and fit the observed diagram with model populations to derive the star formation history of the nuclear cluster. We find (1) that the average nuclear star formation rate dropped from an initial maximum ~10 Gyr ago to a deep minimum 1-2 Gyr ago and increased again during the last few hundred Myrs, (2) that roughly 80% of the stellar mass formed more than 5 Gyr ago, and (3) that mass estimates within R ~ 1 pc from Sgr A* favor a dominant star formation mode with a "normal" Chabrier/Kroupa initial mass function for the majority of the past star formation in the GC. The bulk stellar mass seems to have formed under conditions significantly different from the young stellar disks, perhaps because at the time of the formation of the nuclear cluster the massive black hole and its sphere of influence were much smaller than today.

	Abstract = {Context. Mass-loss, occurring through radiation driven supersonic winds, is a key issue throughout the evolution of massive stars. Two outstanding problems are currently challenging the theory of radiation-driven winds: wind clumping and the weak-wind problem.  Aims: We seek to obtain accurate mass-loss rates of OB stars at different evolutionary stages to constrain the impact of both problems in our current understanding of massive star winds.  Methods: We perform a multi-wavelength quantitative analysis of a sample of ten Galactic OB-stars by means of the atmospheric code cmfgen, with special emphasis on the L-band window. A detailed investigation is carried out on the potential of Bralpha and Pfgamma as mass-loss and clumping diagnostics.  Results: For objects with dense winds, Bralpha samples the intermediate wind while Pfgamma maps the inner one. In combination with other indicators (UV, Halpha, Brgamma) these lines enable us to constrain the wind clumping structure and to obtain "true" mass-loss rates. For objects with weak winds, Bralpha emerges as a reliable diagnostic tool to constrain M. The emission component at the line Doppler-core superimposed on the rather shallow Stark absorption wings reacts very sensitively to mass loss already at very low M values. On the other hand, the line wings display similar sensitivity to mass loss as Halpha, the classical optical mass loss diagnostics.  Conclusions: Our investigation reveals the great diagnostic potential of L-band spectroscopy to derive clumping properties and mass-loss rates of hot star winds. We are confident that Bralpha will become the primary diagnostic tool to measure very low mass-loss rates with unprecedented accuracy.

@article{Portegies-Zwart:2018kt,
	Abstract = {The Solar system was once rich in the short-lived radionuclide (SLR) $^{26}$Al\, but deprived in $^{60}$Fe. Several models have been proposed to explain these anomalous abundances in SLRs, but none has been set within a self-consistent framework of the evolution of the Solar system and its birth environment. The anomalous abundance in $^{26}$Al may have originated from the accreted material in the wind of a massive $\apgt 20$\,$M_\odot$ Wolf-Rayet star, but the star could also have been a member of the parental star-cluster instead of an interloper or an older generation that enriched the proto-solar nebula. The protoplanetary disk at that time was already truncated around the Kuiper-cliff (at $45$ au) by encounters with another cluster members before it was enriched by the wind of the nearby Wolf-Rayet star. The supernova explosion of a nearby star, possibly but not necessarily the exploding Wolf-Rayet star, heated the disk to $\apgt 1500$K, melting small dust grains and causing the encapsulation and preservation of $^{26}$Al into vitreous droplets. This supernova, and possibly several others, caused a further abrasion of the disk and led to its observed tilt of $5.6\pm1.2^\circ$ with respect to the Sun's equatorial plane. The abundance of $^{60}$Fe originates from a supernova shell, but its preservation results from a subsequent supernova. At least two supernovae are needed (one to deliver $^{60}$Fe\, and one to preserve it in the disk) to explain the observed characteristics of the Solar system. The most probable birth cluster then has $N = 2500\pm300$ stars and a radius of $r_{\rm vir} = 0.75\pm0.25$ pc. We conclude that Solar systems equivalent systems form in the Milky Way Galaxy at a rate of about 30 per Myr, in which case approximately 36,000 Solar system analogues roam the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We aim to constrain the properties and evolutionary status of early and mid-spectral type supergiants (from O4 to O7.5). These posses the highest mass-loss rates among the O stars, and exhibit conspicuous wind profiles.  Methods: Using the non-LTE wind code cmfgen we simultaneously analyzed the FUV-UV and optical spectral range to determine the photospheric properties and wind parameters. We derived effective temperatures, luminosities, surface gravities, surface abundances, mass-loss rates, wind terminal velocities, and clumping filling factors.  Results: The supergiants define a very clear evolutionary sequence, in terms of ages and masses, from younger and more massive stars to older stars with lower initial masses. O4 supergiants cluster around the 3 Myr isochrone and are more massive than 60 M&sun;, while the O5 to O7.5 stars have masses in the range 50-40 M&sun; and are 4 $\pm$ 0.3 Myr old. The surface chemical composition is typical of evolved O supergiants (nitrogen-rich, carbon- and oxygen-poor). While the observed ranges of carbon and nitrogen mass-fractions are compatible with those expected from evolutionary models for the measured stellar masses, the N/C ratios as a function of age are inconsistent with the theoretical predictions for the four earliest (O4 spectral type) stars of the sample. We question the efficiency of rotational mixing as a function of age for these stars and suggest that another mechanism may be needed to explain the observed abundance patterns. Mass-loss rates derived with clumped-models range within a factor of three of the theoretical mass-loss rates. The corresponding volume-filling factors associated with small-scale clumping are 0.05 $\pm$ 0.02. Clumping is found to start close to the photosphere for all but three stars, two of which are fast rotators.

	Abstract = {We determine the dynamical distance D, inclination i, mass-to-light ratio M/L and the intrinsic orbital structure of the globular cluster omega Cen, by fitting axisymmetric dynamical models to the ground-based proper motions of van Leeuwen et al. and line-of-sight velocities from four independent data-sets. We bring the kinematic measurements onto a common coordinate system, and select on cluster membership and on measurement error. This provides a homogeneous data-set of 2295 stars with proper motions accurate to 0.20 mas yr-1 and 2163 stars with line-of-sight velocities accurate to 2 km s-1, covering a radial range out to about half the tidal radius. We correct the observed velocities for perspective rotation caused by the space motion of the cluster, and show that the residual solid-body rotation component in the proper motions (caused by relative rotation of the photographic plates from which they were derived) can be taken out without any modelling other than assuming axisymmetry. This also provides a tight constraint on D tan i. The corrected mean velocity fields are consistent with regular rotation, and the velocity dispersion fields display significant deviations from isotropy. We model omega Cen with an axisymmetric implementation of Schwarzschild's orbit superposition method, which accurately fits the surface brightness distribution, makes no assumptions about the degree of velocity anisotropy in the cluster, and allows for radial variations in M/L. We bin the individual measurements on the plane of the sky to search efficiently through the parameter space of the models. Tests on an analytic model demonstrate that this approach is capable of measuring the cluster distance to an accuracy of about 6 per cent. Application to omega Cen reveals no dynamical evidence for a significant radial dependence of M/L, in harmony with the relatively long relaxation time of the cluster. The best-fit dynamical model has a stellar V-band mass-to-light ratio M/L_V=2.5$\pm$0.1 M_&sun;/L_&sun; and an inclination i=50$\,^{\circ}$$\pm$4$\,^{\circ}$, which corresponds to an average intrinsic axial ratio of 0.78$\pm$0.03. The best-fit dynamical distance D=4.8$\pm$0.3 kpc (distance modulus 13.75$\pm$0.13 mag) is significantly larger than obtained by means of simple spherical or constant-anisotropy axisymmetric dynamical models, and is consistent with the canonical value 5.0$\pm$0.2 kpc obtained by photometric methods. The total mass of the cluster is (2.5$\pm$0.3)×106 M_&sun;. The best-fit model is close to isotropic inside a radius of about 10 arcmin and becomes increasingly tangentially anisotropic in the outer region, which displays significant mean rotation. This phase-space structure may well be caused by the effects of the tidal field of the Milky Way. The cluster contains a separate disk-like component in the radial range between 1 and 3 arcmin, contributing about 4% to the total mass.},

	Abstract = {How very massive stars form is still an open question in astrophysics. VFTS682 is among the most massive stars known, with an inferred initial mass of $\sim$150 $M_\odot$ . It is located in 30 Doradus at a projected distance of 29 pc from the central cluster R136. Its apparent isolation led to two hypotheses: either it formed in relative isolation or it was ejected dynamically from the cluster. We investigate the kinematics of VFTS682 as obtained by Gaia and Hubble Space Telescope astrometry. We derive a projected velocity relative to the cluster of $38 \pm 17 \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$ (1$\sigma$ confidence interval). Although the error bars are substantial, two independent measures suggest that VFTS682 is a runaway ejected from the central cluster. This hypothesis is further supported by a variety of circumstantial clues. The central cluster is known to harbor other stars more massive than 150 $M_\odot$ of similar spectral type and recent astrometric studies on VFTS16 and VFTS72 provide direct evidence that the cluster can eject some of its most massive members, in agreement with theoretical predictions. If future data confirm the runaway nature, this would make VFTS682 the most massive runaway star known to date.},

	Abstract = {We examine the spatial distribution and mass segregation of dense molecular cloud cores in a number of nearby star forming regions (Taurus, Aquila, Corona Australis, W43) that span about 4 orders of magnitude in star formation activity. We use an approach based on the calculation of the minimum spanning tree, and for each region, we calculate the structure parameter Q and the mass segregation ratio measured for various numbers of the most massive cores. Our results indicate that the distribution of dense cores in young star forming regions is very substructured and that it is very likely that this substructure will be imprinted onto the nascent clusters that will emerge out of these clouds. With the exception of Taurus in which there is no mass segregation, we observe mild-to-significant levels of mass segregation for the 6th, 10th, and 14th most massive cores in Aquila, Corona Australis, and W43, respectively. Our results suggest that the clouds' star formation activity are linked to their structure, as traced by their population of dense cores. We also find that the fraction of massive cores that are the most mass segregated in each region correlates with the surface density of star formation in the clouds. The low star forming region of Taurus is associated with a highly hierarchical spatial distribution of the cores (low Q value) and the cores show no sign of being mass segregated. On the other extreme, the mini-starburst region W43 has a higher Q that is suggestive of a more centrally condensed structure and it possesses a higher fraction of massive cores that are segregated by mass. While some limited evolutionary effects might be present, we largely attribute the correlation between the star formation activity of the clouds and their structure to a dependence on the physical conditions that have been imprinted on them by the large scale environment at the time they started to form},

	Abstract = {The Quintuplet and Arches clusters, which were formed in the harsh environment of the Galactic Centre (GC) a few million years ago, have been excellent targets for studying the effects of a star-forming environment on the initial mass function (IMF). In order to estimate the shape of the low-end IMF of the Arches cluster, Shin & Kim devised a novel photometric method that utilizes pixel intensity histograms (PIHs) of the observed images. Here, we apply the PIH method to the Quintuplet cluster and estimate the shape of its low-end IMF below the magnitude of completeness limit as set by conventional photometry. We found that the low-end IMF of the Quintuplet is consistent with that found for the Arches cluster-Kroupa MF, with a significant number of low-mass stars below 1 M&sun;. We conclude that the most likely IMFs of the Quintuplet and the Arches clusters are not too different from the IMFs found in the Galactic disc. We also find that the observed PIHs and stellar number density profiles of both clusters are best reproduced when the clusters are assumed to be at three-dimensional distances of approximately 100 pc from the GC.},

@article{Gaia-Collaboration:2018pl,
	Abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 provides high-precision astrometry and three-band photometry for about 1.3 billion sources over the full sky. The precision, accuracy, and homogeneity of both astrometry and photometry are unprecedented.  Aims: We highlight the power of the Gaia DR2 in studying many fine structures of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Gaia allows us to present many different HRDs, depending in particular on stellar population selections. We do not aim here for completeness in terms of types of stars or stellar evolutionary aspects. Instead, we have chosen several illustrative examples.  Methods: We describe some of the selections that can be made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main structures of the Gaia HRDs. We select both field and cluster (open and globular) stars, compare the observations with previous classifications and with stellar evolutionary tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD with age, metallicity, and kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as hot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs are also analysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects.  Results: The Gaia HRDs are unprecedented in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar populations and stellar evolutionary phases. Many fine structures of the HRDs are presented. The clear split of the white dwarf sequence into hydrogen and helium white dwarfs is presented for the first time in an HRD. The relation between kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated. Two different populations in a classical kinematic selection of the halo are unambiguously identified in the HRD. Membership and mean parameters for a selected list of open clusters are provided. They allow drawing very detailed cluster sequences, highlighting fine structures, and providing extremely precise empirical isochrones that will lead to more insight in stellar physics.  Conclusions: Gaia DR2 demonstrates the potential of combining precise astrometry and photometry for large samples for studies in stellar evolution and stellar population and opens an entire new area for HRD-based studies.

	Abstract = {Context. The second Gaia data release (DR2) contains very precise astrometric and photometric properties for more than one billion sources, astrophysical parameters for dozens of millions, radial velocities for millions, variability information for half a million stars from selected variability classes, and orbits for thousands of solar system objects.  Aims: Before the catalogue was published, these data have undergone dedicated validation processes. The goal of this paper is to describe the validation results in terms of completeness, accuracy, and precision of the various Gaia DR2 data.  Methods: The validation processes include a systematic analysis of the catalogue content to detect anomalies, either individual errors or statistical properties, using statistical analysis and comparisons to external data or to models.  Results: Although the astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data are of unprecedented quality and quantity, it is shown that the data cannot be used without dedicated attention to the limitations described here, in the catalogue documentation and in accompanying papers. We place special emphasis on the caveats for the statistical use of the data in scientific exploitation. In particular, we discuss the quality filters and the consideration of the properties, systematics, and uncertainties from astrometry to astrophysical parameters, together with the various selection functions.},

	Abstract = {Newly acquired data and improved data reduction algorithms mandate a fresh look at the absolute flux calibration of the charge-coupled device cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The goals are to achieve a 1% accuracy and to make this calibration more accessible to the HST guest investigator. Absolute fluxes from the CALSPEC1 database for three primary hot 30,000-60,000K WDs define the sensitivity calibrations for the Wide Field Channel (WFC) and High Resolution Channel (HRC) filters. The external uncertainty for the absolute flux is ˜1%, while the internal consistency of the sensitivities in the broadband ACS filters is ˜0.3% among the three primary WD flux standards. For stars as cool as K type, the agreement with the CALSPEC standards is within 1% at the WFC1-1K subarray position, which achieves the 1% precision goal for the first time. After making a small adjustment to the filter bandpass for F814W, the 1% precision goal is achieved over the full F814W WFC field of view for stars of K type and hotter. New encircled energies and absolute sensitivities replace the seminal results of Sirianni et al. that were published in 2005. After implementing the throughput updates, synthetic predictions of the WFC and HRC count rates for the average of the three primary WD standard stars agree with the observations to 0.1%.},

	Abstract = {For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution. Here, we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction toward, individual stars. We analyze the characteristics of the catalog and validate it using clusters. The catalog can be queried using ADQL at http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/tap.html (which also hosts the Gaia catalog) and downloaded from http://www.mpia.de/~calj/gdr2_distances.html.},

	Abstract = {Astrometric surveys such as Gaia and LSST will measure parallaxes for hundreds of millions of stars. Yet they will not measure a single distance. Rather, a distance must be estimated from a parallax. In this didactic article, I show that doing this is not trivial once the fractional parallax error is larger than about 20%, which will be the case for about 80% of stars in the Gaia catalogue. Estimating distances is an inference problem in which the use of prior assumptions is unavoidable. I investigate the properties and performance of various priors and examine their implications. A supposed uninformative uniform prior in distance is shown to give very poor distance estimates (large bias and variance). Any prior with a sharp cut-off at some distance has similar problems. The choice of prior depends on the information one has available - and is willing to use - concerning, for example, the survey and the Galaxy. I demonstrate that a simple prior which decreases asymptotically to zero at infinite distance has good performance, accommodates non-positive parallaxes, and does not require a bias correction.},

	Abstract = {Shanks et al. (2018) arXiv:1810.02595 make two claims that they argue bring the local measurement and early Universe prediction of H0 into agreement: A) they claim that Gaia DR2 parallax measurements show the geometric calibration of the Cepheid distance scale used to measure H0 to be grossly in error and B) that we live near the middle of an enormous void, further biasing the local measurement of the Hubble constant. We show that the first claim is caused by five erroneous uses of the data: in decreasing order of importance: 1) the use of a distance indicator, main sequence fitting of cluster stars, which is unrelated to the calibration of Cepheids and therefore has no bearing on current measurements of H0; 2) the use of Gaia data for Cepheids that fully saturate the detector, producing unreliable parallaxes; 3) the use of a fixed parallax offset which is known to depend on source magnitude and color but which is derived for sources with extremely different colors and magnitudes; 4) ignoring the uncertainty in this offset; and 5) ignoring the other geometric sources of Cepheid calibration, the distance of the LMC from detached eclipsing binaries and the masers in NGC 4258, which are independent of Milky Way parallaxes. Just resolving the first two of these issues by not using unrelated or saturated data leads to no inconsistency between Gaia parallaxes and the current Cepheid distance scale. The second claim can be refuted 6) because of the increase in chi-squared that the alleged void would entail in SN measurements in the Hubble flow, and 7) because it would represent a 6 sigma fluctuation of cosmic variance between the local and globally measured expansion, requiring us to live in an exceedingly special location.},

	Abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of a selected sample of 50 long-period, low-extinction Milky Way Cepheids measured on the same WFC3 F555W-, F814W-, and F160W-band photometric system as extragalactic Cepheids in Type Ia supernova host galaxies. These bright Cepheids were observed with the WFC3 spatial scanning mode in the optical and near-infrared to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration errors to reach a mean photometric error of 5 mmag per observation. We use the new Gaia DR2 parallaxes and HST photometry to simultaneously constrain the cosmic distance scale and to measure the DR2 parallax zeropoint offset appropriate for Cepheids. We find the latter to be -46 $\pm$ 13 muas or $\pm$6 muas for a fixed distance scale, higher than found from quasars, as expected for these brighter and redder sources. The precision of the distance scale from DR2 has been reduced by a factor of 2.5 because of the need to independently determine the parallax offset. The best-fit distance scale is 1.006 $\pm$ 0.033, relative to the scale from Riess et al. with H 0 = 73.24 km s-1 Mpc-1 used to predict the parallaxes photometrically, and is inconsistent with the scale needed to match the Planck 2016 cosmic microwave background data combined with LambdaCDM at the 2.9sigma confidence level (99.6%). At 96.5% confidence we find that the formal DR2 errors may be underestimated as indicated. We identify additional errors associated with the use of augmented Cepheid samples utilizing ground-based photometry and discuss their likely origins. Including the DR2 parallaxes with all prior distance-ladder data raises the current tension between the late and early universe route to the Hubble constant to 3.8sigma (99.99%). With the final expected precision from Gaia, the sample of 50 Cepheids with HST photometry will limit to 0.5% the contribution of the first rung of the distance ladder to the uncertainty in H 0.},

	Abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase.  Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task.  Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion.  Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G < 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr-1, respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr-1. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr-1 in proper motion are seen on small (< 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

	Abstract = {We present a method to infer reddenings and distances to stars based only on their broad-band photometry, and show how this method can be used to produce a three-dimensional (3D) dust map of the Galaxy. Our method samples from the full probability density function of distance, reddening, and stellar type for individual stars, as well as the full uncertainty in reddening as a function of distance in the 3D dust map. We incorporate prior knowledge of the distribution of stars in the Galaxy and the detection limits of the survey. For stars in the Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) 3pi survey, we demonstrate that our reddening estimates are unbiased and accurate to ~0.13 mag in E(B - V) for the typical star. Based on comparisons with mock catalogs, we expect distances for main-sequence stars to be constrained to within ~20%-60%, although this range can vary, depending on the reddening of the star, the precise stellar type, and its position on the sky. A later paper will present a 3D map of dust over the three quarters of the sky surveyed by PS1. Both the individual stellar inferences and the 3D dust map will enable a wealth of Galactic science in the plane. The method we present is not limited to the passbands of the PS1 survey but may be extended to incorporate photometry from other surveys, such as the Two Micron All Sky Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (where available), and in the future, LSST and Gaia.},

	Abstract = {We present a three-dimensional map of interstellar dust reddening, covering three-quarters of the sky out to a distance of several kiloparsecs, based on Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) and 2MASS photometry. The map reveals a wealth of detailed structure, from filaments to large cloud complexes. The map has a hybrid angular resolution, with most of the map at an angular resolution of 3\buildrel{ \prime}\over{.} 4-13\buildrel{ \prime}\over{.} 7, and a maximum distance resolution of ˜ 25%. The three-dimensional distribution of dust is determined in a fully probabilistic framework, yielding the uncertainty in the reddening distribution along each line of sight, as well as stellar distances, reddenings, and classifications for 800 million stars detected by PS1. We demonstrate the consistency of our reddening estimates with those of two-dimensional emission-based maps of dust reddening. In particular, we find agreement with the Planck {tau }353{GHz}-based reddening map to within 0.05 {mag} in E(B-V) to a depth of 0.5 {mag}, and explore systematics at reddenings less than E(B-V)≈ 0.08 {mag}. We validate our per-star reddening estimates by comparison with reddening estimates for stars with both Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry and Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration spectral classifications, finding per-star agreement to within 0.1 {mag} out to a stellar E(B-V) of 1 mag. We compare our map to two existing three-dimensional dust maps, by Marshall et al. and Lallement et al., demonstrating our finer angular resolution, and better distance resolution compared to the former within ˜ 3 {kpc}. The map can be queried or downloaded at http://argonaut.skymaps.info. We expect the three-dimensional reddening map presented here to find a wide range of uses, among them correcting for reddening and extinction for objects embedded in the plane of the Galaxy, studies of Galactic structure, calibration of future emission-based dust maps, and determining distances to objects of known reddening.},

	Abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 mum map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 mum data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 mum map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected.  To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 mum DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 mum flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 mum map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 mum and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 mum (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field.  The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 mum emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

@article{Motte:2018zv,
	Abstract = {Understanding the processes that determine the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is a critical unsolved problem, with profound implications for many areas of astrophysics1. In molecular clouds, stars are formed in cores---gas condensations sufficiently dense that gravitational collapse converts a large fraction of their mass into a star or small clutch of stars. In nearby star-formation regions, the core mass function (CMF) is strikingly similar to the IMF, suggesting that the shape of the IMF may simply be inherited from the CMF2-5. Here, we present 1.3 mm observations, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope, of the active star-formation region W43-MM1, which may be more representative of the Galactic-arm regions where most stars form6,7. The unprecedented resolution of these observations reveals a statistically robust CMF at high masses, with a slope that is markedly shallower than the IMF. This seriously challenges our understanding of the origin of the IMF.},

This calibration is accurate at the level of a few hundredths of a magnitude. The main purpose of this effort is to transform the entire set of evolutionary models into a simple observational photometric system for ACS/WFC data, and to make them available to the astronomical community. We provide the zero-points for the most used ACS/WFC bands, and give basic recipes for calibrating both the observed data and the models. We also present the colour-magnitude diagram from ACS data of five Galactic globular clusters, spanning the metallicity range -2.2 <[Fe/H] < -0.04, and we provide fiducial points representing their sequences from several magnitudes below the turn-off to the red giant branch tip. The observed sequences are compared with the models in the newly defined photometric system.},

	Abstract = {Sgr A* is the supermassive black hole residing in the centre of the Milky Way. There is plenty of observational evidence that a massive gas cloud fell into the central parsec of the Milky Way ˜6 Myr ago, triggering formation of a disc of young stars and activating Sgr A*. In addition to the disc, there is an unexplained population of young stars on randomly oriented orbits. Here we hypothesize that these young stars were formed by fragmentation of a massive quasi-spherical gas shell driven out from Sgr A* potential well by an energetic outflow. To account for the properties of the observed stars, the shell must be more massive than 105 solar masses, be launched from inside ˜0.01 pc, and the feedback outflow has to be highly super-Eddington albeit for a brief period of time, producing kinetic energy of at least 1055 erg. The young stars in the central parsec of the Galaxy may be a unique example of stars formed from atomic rather than molecular hydrogen, and forged by extreme pressure of black hole outflows.},

	Abstract = {Recent spectroscopic analysis has set an upper limit to the age of the S-stars, the ~30 B-type stars on highly eccentric orbits around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic center. The inferred age (<15 Myr) is in tension with the binary break-up scenario for their origin. However, it is curiously compatible with the age of the disk of O-type stars that lies at a farther distance from the SMBH. Here we investigate a new formation scenario, assuming that the both S-stars and the O-type stars were born in the same disk around SgrA*. We simulate encounters between binaries of the stellar disk and stellar black holes from a dark cusp around SgrA*. We find that B-type binaries can get easily disrupted by the encounters and their binary components are kicked into highly eccentric orbits around the SMBH. In contrast, O-type binaries are less frequently disrupted and their members remain on low eccentric orbits. This mechanism can reproduce 11 S-stars just by assuming that the binaries initially lie within the stellar disk as observed nowadays. To reproduce all the S-stars, the original disk must have been extended down to 0.006 pc. However in this case many B- and O-type stars remain on low eccentricity orbits below 0.03 pc, in contrast with the observations. Therefore, some other mechanism is necessary to disperse the disk below 0.03 pc. This scenario can also explain the high eccentricity of the G-objects, if they have a stellar origin.},

	Abstract = {We present and describe the astro-photometric catalog of more than 800,000 sources found in the Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project (HTTP). HTTP is a Hubble Space Telescope Treasury program designed to image the entire 30 Doradus region down to the sub-solar (˜0.5 M&sun;) mass regime using the Wide Field Camera 3 and the Advanced Camera for Surveys. We observed 30 Doradus in the near-ultraviolet (F275W, F336W), optical (F555W, F658N, F775W), and near-infrared (F110W, F160W) wavelengths. The stellar photometry was measured using point-spread function fitting across all bands simultaneously. The relative astrometric accuracy of the catalog is 0.4 mas. The astro-photometric catalog, results from artificial star experiments, and the mosaics for all the filters are available for download. Color-magnitude diagrams are presented showing the spatial distributions and ages of stars within 30 Dor as well as in the surrounding fields. HTTP provides the first rich and statistically significant sample of intermediate- and low-mass pre-main sequence candidates and allows us to trace how star formation has been developing through the region. The depth and high spatial resolution of our analysis highlight the dual role of stellar feedback in quenching and triggering star formation on the giant H II region scale. Our results are consistent with stellar sub-clustering in a partially filled gaseous nebula that is offset toward our side of the Large Magellanic Cloud.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Anticipating the kinematic constraints from the Gaia mission, we perform an extensive numerical study of the evolution of massive binary systems to predict the peculiar velocities that stars obtain when their companion collapses and disrupts the system. Our aim is to (1) identify which predictions are robust against model uncertainties and assess their implications, (2) investigate which physical processes leave a clear imprint and may therefore be constrained observationally and (3) provide a suite of publicly available model predictions. We find that $22_{-8}^{+26}$% of all massive binary systems merge prior to the first core collapse in the system. Of the remainder, $86_{-9}^{+11}$% become unbound because of the core-collapse. Remarkably, this rarely produce runaway stars (i.e., stars with velocities above 30 km/s). These are outnumbered by more than an order of magnitude by slower unbound companions, or "walkaway stars". This is a robust outcome of our simulations and is due to the reversal of the mass ratio prior to the explosion and widening of the orbit, as we show analytically and numerically. We estimate a $10^{+5}_{-8}$% of massive stars to be walkaways and only $0.5^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$% to be runaways, nearly all of which have accreted mass from their companion. Our findings are consistent with earlier studies, however the low runaway fraction we find is in tension with observed fractions 10%. If Gaia confirms these high fractions of massive runaway stars resulting from binaries, it would imply that we are currently missing physics in the binary models. Finally, we show that high end of the mass distributions of runaway stars is very sensitive to the assumed black hole natal kicks and propose this as a potentially stringent test for the explosion mechanism. We discuss companions remaining bound which can evolve into X-ray and gravitational wave sources.},

	Abstract = {Using proper motion measurements from Gaia DR2, we probe the origin of 26 previously known hypervelocity stars (HVSs) around the Milky Way. We find that a significant fraction of these stars have a high probability of originating close to the Milky Way centre, but there is one obvious outlier. HVS3 is highly likely to be coming almost from the centre of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). During its closest approach, $21.1^{+6.1}_{-4.6}$ Myr ago, it had a relative velocity of $870^{+69}_{-66}$ kms$^{-1}$ with respect to the LMC. This large kick velocity is only consistent with the Hills mechanism, requiring a massive black hole at the centre of the LMC. This provides strong direct evidence that the LMC itself harbours a massive black hole of at least $4\times 10^3 -10^4 M_\odot$.},

	Abstract = {We explore the hypothesis that some high-velocity runaway stars attain their peculiar velocities in the course of exchange encounters between hard massive binaries and a very massive star (either an ordinary 50-100Msolar star or a more massive one, formed through runaway mergers of ordinary stars in the core of a young massive star cluster). In this process, one of the binary components becomes gravitationally bound to the very massive star, while the second one is ejected, sometimes with a high speed. We performed three-body scattering experiments and found that early B-type stars (the progenitors of the majority of neutron stars) can be ejected with velocities of >~200-400kms-1 (typical of pulsars), while 3-4Msolar stars can attain velocities of >~300-400kms-1 (typical of the bound population of halo late B-type stars). We also found that the ejected stars can occasionally attain velocities exceeding the Milky Ways's escape velocity.},

@article{Irrgang:2018lh,
	Abstract = {Young massive stars in the halo are supposed to be runaway stars from the Galactic disk. Possible ejection scenarios are binary supernova ejections (BSE) or dynamical ejections from star clusters (DE). Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are extreme runaway stars that are potentially unbound to the Galaxy. Powerful acceleration mechanisms like the tidal disruption of a binary by a supermassive black hole are required. Hence, HVSs are believed to originate in the Galactic center (GC). Gaia DR2 offers the opportunity to study HVSs in an unprecedented manner. We revisit the most interesting HVSs, i.e., 15 stars for which proper motions with the Hubble Space Telescope were obtained in the pre-Gaia era, to unravel their origin. By carrying out kinematic analyses in three different Galactic mass models, kinematic properties are obtained that help to constrain the spatial origins of the HVSs. While HVSs previously considered unbound remain unbound in two Galactic potentials, most stars become bound in the most massive Galactic model. For nine stars (including five unbound candidates), the GC can be ruled out as spatial origin at $2\sigma$ confidence. Using optical and infrared photometry to determine its spectrophotometric distance, we confirm that HVS3 originates in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our results suggest that a large fraction of the HVSs are actually disk runaway stars launched close to or beyond Galactic escape velocities. Population synthesis models predict that only a small fraction of the HVSs stems from BSE. Furthermore, a maximum ejection velocity of 540\,km/s is predicted for BSE and a similar limit has been found for DE. The ejection velocities of five of our non-GC HVSs are close to or above this limit, calling for the existence of another dynamical ejection mechanism (e.g., massive perturbers such as intermediate mass black holes) besides the classical scenarios mentioned above.},

	Abstract = {The recent detection of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) as late-type B-stars and HVS candidate G/K dwarfs raises the important question of their origin. In this Letter, we investigate the maximum possible velocities of such HVSs if they are produced from binaries which are disrupted via an asymmetric supernova explosion. We find that HVSs up to ˜770 and ˜1280 km s-1 are possible in the Galactic rest frame from this scenario for these two subclasses of HVSs, respectively. We conclude that whereas a binary origin cannot easily explain all of the observed velocities of B-type HVSs (in agreement with their proposed central massive black hole origin) it can indeed account for the far majority (if not all) of the recently detected G/K-dwarf HVS candidates.},

	Abstract = {Runaway stars are stars observed to have large peculiar velocities. Two mechanisms are thought to contribute to the ejection of runaway stars, both of which involve binarity (or higher multiplicity). In the binary supernova scenario, a runaway star receives its velocity when its binary massive companion explodes as a supernova (SN). In the alternative dynamical ejection scenario, runaway stars are formed through gravitational interactions between stars and binaries in dense, compact clusters or cluster cores. Here we study the ejection scenario. We make use of extensive N-body simulations of massive clusters, as well as analytic arguments, in order to characterize the expected ejection velocity distribution of runaway stars. We find that the ejection velocity distribution of the fastest runaways (v >~ 80 km s-1) depends on the binary distribution in the cluster, consistent with our analytic toy model, whereas the distribution of lower velocity runaways appears independent of the binaries' properties. For a realistic log constant distribution of binary separations, we find the velocity distribution to follow a simple power law: Gamma(v)vpropv -8/3 for the high-velocity runaways and v -3/2 for the low-velocity ones. We calculate the total expected ejection rates of runaway stars from our simulated massive clusters and explore their mass function and their binarity. The mass function of runaway stars is biased toward high masses and strongly depends on their velocity. The binarity of runaways is a decreasing function of their ejection velocity, with no binaries expected to be ejected with v > 150 km s-1. We also find that hyper-runaways with velocities of hundreds of km s-1 can be dynamically ejected from stellar clusters, but only at very low rates, which cannot account for a significant fraction of the observed population of hyper-velocity stars in the Galactic halo.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery of five new unbound hypervelocity stars (HVSs) in the outer Milky Way halo. Using a conservative estimate of Galactic escape velocity, our targeted spectroscopic survey has now identified 16 unbound HVSs as well as a comparable number of HVSs ejected on bound trajectories. A Galactic center origin for the HVSs is supported by their unbound velocities, the observed number of unbound stars, their stellar nature, their ejection time distribution, and their Galactic latitude and longitude distribution. Other proposed origins for the unbound HVSs, such as runaway ejections from the disk or dwarf galaxy tidal debris, cannot be reconciled with the observations. An intriguing result is the spatial anisotropy of HVSs on the sky, which possibly reflects an anisotropic potential in the central 10-100 pc region of the Galaxy. Further progress requires measurement of the spatial distribution of HVSs over the southern sky. Our survey also identifies seven B supergiants associated with known star-forming galaxies; the absence of B supergiants elsewhere in the survey implies there are no new star-forming galaxies in our survey footprint to a depth of 1-2 Mpc.},

	Abstract = {Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) travel with such extreme velocities that dynamical ejection via gravitational interaction with a massive black hole (MBH) is their most likely origin. Observers have discovered dozens of unbound main-sequence stars since the first in 2005, and the velocities, stellar nature, spatial distribution, and overall numbers of unbound B stars in the Milky Way halo all fit an MBH origin. Theorists have proposed various mechanisms for ejecting unbound stars, and these mechanisms can be tested with larger and more complete samples. HVSs' properties are linked to the nature and environment of the Milky Way's MBH, and, with future proper motion measurements, their trajectories may provide unique probes of the dark matter halo that surrounds the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {We obtain Keck HIRES spectroscopy of HVS5, one of the fastest unbound stars in the Milky Way halo. We show that HVS5 is a 3.62 $\pm$ 0.11 M &sun; main-sequence B star at a distance of 50 $\pm$ 5 kpc. The difference between its age and its flight time from the Galactic center is 105 $\pm$ 18 (stat) $\pm$30 (sys) Myr; flight times from locations elsewhere in the Galactic disk are similar. This 108 yr "arrival time" between formation and ejection is difficult to reconcile with any ejection scenario involving massive stars that live for only 107 yr. For comparison, we derive arrival times of 107 yr for two unbound runaway B stars, consistent with their disk origin where ejection results from a supernova in a binary system or dynamical interactions between massive stars in a dense star cluster. For HVS5, ejection during the first 107 yr of its lifetime is ruled out at the 3sigma level. Together with the 108 yr arrival times inferred for three other well-studied hypervelocity stars (HVSs), these results are consistent with a Galactic center origin for the HVSs. If the HVSs were indeed ejected by the central black hole, then the Galactic center was forming stars sime200 Myr ago, and the progenitors of the HVSs took sime100 Myr to enter the black hole's loss cone.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the link between the hypervelocity stars (HVSs) discovered in the Galactic halo and the Galactic center (GC) S-stars, under the hypothesis that they are both the products of the tidal breakup of the same population of stellar binaries by the central massive black hole (MBH). By adopting several hypothetical models for binaries to be injected into the vicinity of the MBH and doing numerical simulations, we realize the tidal breakup processes of the binaries and their follow-up dynamical evolution. We find that many statistical properties of the detected HVSs and GC S-stars could be reproduced under some binary injecting models, and their number ratio can be reproduced if the stellar initial mass function is top-heavy (e.g., with slope ~ - 1.6). The total number of the captured companions is ~50 that have masses in the range ~3-7 M &sun; and semimajor axes <~ 4000 AU and survive to the present within their main-sequence lifetime. The innermost one is expected to have a semimajor axis ~300-1500 AU and a pericenter distance ~10-200 AU, with a significant probability of being closer to the MBH than S2. Future detection of such a close star would offer an important test to general relativity. The majority of the surviving ejected companions of the GC S-stars are expected to be located at Galactocentric distances <~ 20 kpc, and have heliocentric radial velocities ~ - 500-1500 km s-1 and proper motions up to ~5-20 mas yr-1. Future detection of these HVSs may provide evidence for the tidal breakup formation mechanism of the GC S-stars.},

	Abstract = {We measure proper motions with the Hubble Space Telescope for 16 extreme radial velocity stars, mostly unbound B stars in the Milky Way halo. Twelve of these stars have proper motions statistically consistent with zero, and thus have radial trajectories statistically consistent with a Galactic center ``hypervelocity star'' origin. The trajectory of HE 0437-5439 is consistent with both Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud origins. A Galactic center origin is excluded at 3sigma confidence for two of the lowest radial velocity stars in our sample, however. These two stars are probable disk runaways and provide evidence for ˜500 km s-1 ejections from the disk. We also measure a significant proper motion for the unbound sdO star US 708. Its 1000 km s-1 motion is in some tension with proposed supernova ejection models, but can be explained if US 708 was ejected from the stellar halo. In the future, we expect Gaia will better constrain the origin of these remarkable unbound stars.

	Abstract = {We study three processes that eject hypervelocity (>103 km s-1) stars from the Galactic center: (1) close encounters of two single stars, (2) tidal breakup of binary stars by the central black hole, as originally proposed by Hills, and (3) three-body interactions between a star and a binary black hole (BBH). Mechanism 1 expels hypervelocity stars to the solar radius, R0=8 kpc, at a negligible rate, ~10-11 yr-1. Mechanism 2 expels hypervelocity stars at a rate ~10-5(eta/0.1) yr-1, where eta is the fraction of stars in binaries with semimajor axis ab<~0.3 AU. For solar mass stars, the corresponding number of hypervelocity stars within the solar radius is ~60(eta/0.1)(ab/0.1AU)1/2. For mechanism 3, Sgr A* is assumed to be one component of a BBH. We constrain the allowed parameter space (semimajor axis, mass ratio) of the BBH. In the allowed region (for example, a semimajor axis of 0.5×10-3 pc and a mass ratio of 0.01), the rate of ejection of hypervelocity stars can be as large as ~10-4 yr-1, and the expected number of hypervelocity stars within the solar radius can be as large as ~103. Hypervelocity stars may be detectable by the next generation of large-scale optical surveys.},

	Abstract = {We have discovered a star, SDSS J090745.0+024507, leaving the Galaxy with a heliocentric radial velocity of 853+/-12 km s-1, the largest velocity ever observed in the Milky Way halo. The star is either a hot blue horizontal-branch star or a B9 main-sequence star with a heliocentric distance of 39 or 71 kpc, respectively. Corrected for the solar reflex motion and to the local standard of rest, the Galactic rest-frame velocity is 709 km s-1. We suggest that this star is the first example of a hypervelocity star ejected from the Galactic center, as predicted by Hills and later discussed by Yu & Tremaine. The star's radial velocity vector points 174$\,^{\circ}$ from the Galactic center. The star has [Fe/H]~0, consistent with a Galactic center origin, and a travel time of <~80 Myr from the Galactic center, consistent with its stellar lifetime. If the star is indeed traveling from the Galactic center, it should have a proper motion of ~0.3 mas yr-1 observable with the Space Interferometry Mission or the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics.

	Abstract = {Hypervelocity stars are intriguing rare objects travelling at speeds large enough to be unbound from the Milky Way. Several mechanisms have been proposed for producing them, including the interaction of the Galaxy's supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a binary; rapid mass-loss from a companion to a star in a short-period binary; the tidal disruption of an infalling galaxy and finally ejection from the Large Magellanic Cloud. While previously discovered high-velocity early-type stars are thought to be the result of an interaction with the SMBH, the origin of high-velocity late-type stars is ambiguous. The second data release of Gaia (DR2) enables a unique opportunity to resolve this ambiguity and determine whether any late-type candidates are truly unbound from the Milky Way. In this paper, we utilize the new proper motion and velocity information available from DR2 to re-evaluate a collection of historical data compiled on the newly created Open Fast Stars Catalogue. We find that almost all previously known high-velocity late-type stars are most likely bound to the Milky Way. Only one late-type object (LAMOST J115209.12+120258.0) is unbound from the Galaxy. Performing integrations of orbital histories, we find that this object cannot have been ejected from the Galactic centre and thus may be either debris from the disruption of a satellite galaxy or a disc runaway.},

	Abstract = {We describe our completed spectroscopic survey for unbound hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected from the Milky Way. Three new discoveries bring the total number of unbound late B-type stars to 21. We place new constraints on the nature of the stars and on their distances using moderate resolution MMT spectroscopy. Half of the stars are fast rotators; they are certain 2.5-4 M &sun; main sequence stars at 50-120 kpc distances. Correcting for stellar lifetime, our survey implies that unbound 2.5-4 M &sun; stars are ejected from the Milky Way at a rate of 1.5 × 10-6 yr-1. These unbound HVSs are likely ejected continuously over the past 200 Myr and do not share a common flight time. The anisotropic spatial distribution of HVSs on the sky remains puzzling. Southern hemisphere surveys like SkyMapper will soon allow us to map the all-sky distribution of HVSs. Future proper motion measurements with Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia will provide strong constraints on origin. Existing observations are all consistent with HVS ejections from encounters with the massive black hole in the Galactic center.},

Halo stars dominate the sample at speeds about 100 km/s below Galactic escape velocity. Disk runaway stars have speeds up to 100 km/s above Galactic escape velocity, but most disk runaways are bound. Stars with speeds about 100 km/s above Galactic escape velocity originate from the Galactic center. Two bound stars may also originate from the Galactic center. Future Gaia measurements will enable a large, clean sample of Galactic center ejections for measuring the massive black hole ejection rate of hypervelocity stars, and for constraining the mass distribution of the Milky Way dark matter halo.},

@article{Weisz:2015sf,
	Abstract = {We have undertaken the largest systematic study of the high-mass stellar initial mass function (IMF) to date using the optical color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of 85 resolved, young (4 {Myr}\lt t\lt 25 {Myr}), intermediate mass star clusters (103-104 M&sun;), observed as part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury program. We fit each cluster's CMD to measure its mass function (MF) slope for stars ≳2 M&sun;. By modeling the ensemble of clusters, we find the distribution of MF slopes is best described by Gamma  = +{1.45}-0.06+0.03 with a very small intrinsic scatter and no drastic outliers. This model allows the MF slope to depend on cluster mass, size, and age, but the data imply no significant dependencies within this regime of cluster properties. The lack of an age dependence suggests that the MF slope has not significantly evolved over the first ˜25 Myr and provides direct observational evidence that the measured MF represents the IMF. Taken together, this analysis---based on an unprecedented large sample of young clusters, homogeneously constructed CMDs, well-defined selection criteria, and consistent principled modeling---implies that the high-mass IMF slope in M31 clusters is universal. The IMF has a slope (Gamma  = +{1.45}-0.06+0.03; statistical uncertainties) that is slightly steeper than the canonical Kroupa (+1.30) and Salpeter (+1.35) values, and our measurement of it represents a factor of ˜20 improvement in precision over the Kroupa IMF (+1.30 $\pm$ 0.7). Using our inference model on select Milky Way (MW) and LMC high-mass IMF studies from the literature, we find {Gamma }{MW}˜ +1.15+/- 0.1 and {Gamma }{LMC}˜ +1.3+/- 0.1, both with intrinsic scatter of ˜0.3-0.4 dex. Thus, while the high-mass IMF in the Local Group may be universal, systematics in the literature of IMF studies preclude any definitive conclusions; homogenous investigations of the high-mass IMF in the local universe are needed to overcome this limitation. Consequently, the present study represents the most robust measurement of the high-mass IMF slope to date. To facilitate practical use over the full stellar mass spectrum, we have grafted the M31 high-mass IMF slope onto widely used sub-solar mass Kroupa and Chabrier IMFs. The increased steepness in the M31 high-mass IMF slope implies that commonly used UV- and Halpha-based star formation rates should be increased by a factor of ˜1.3-1.5 and the number of stars with masses \gt 8 M&sun; is ˜25% fewer than expected for a Salpeter/Kroupa IMF.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program #12055.},

	Abstract = {For the past 400 years, astronomers have sought to observe and interpret the Universe by building more powerful telescopes. These incredible instruments extend the capabilities of one of our most important senses, sight, towards new limits such as increased sensitivity and resolution, new dimensions such as exploration of wavelengths across the full electromagnetic spectrum, new information content such as analysis through spectroscopy, and new cadences such as rapid time-series views of the variable sky. The results from these investments, from small to large telescopes on the ground and in space, have completely transformed our understanding of the Universe; including the discovery that Earth is not the centre of the Universe, that the Milky Way is one among many galaxies in the Universe, that relic cosmic background radiation fills all space in the early Universe, that that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating, that exoplanets are common around stars, that gravitational waves exist, and much more. For modern astronomical research, the next wave of breakthroughs in fields ranging over planetary, stellar, galactic, and extragalactic science motivate a general-purpose observatory that is optimised at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths, and that has much greater sensitivity, resolution, and spectroscopic multiplexing than all previous telescopes. This scientific vision, from measuring the composition of rocky worlds in the nearby Milky Way galaxy to finding the first sources of light in the Universe to other topics at the forefront of modern astrophysics, motivates the state-of-the-art James Webb Space Telescope (Webb). In this review paper, I summarise the design and technical capabilities of Webb and the scientific opportunities that it enables.},

	Abstract = {Context. Stars constitute the building blocks of our Universe, and their formation is an astrophysical problem of great importance. Aim. We aim to understand the fragmentation of massive molecular star-forming clumps and the effect of initial conditions, namely the density and the level of turbulence, on the resulting distribution of stars. For this purpose, we conduct numerical experiments in which we systematically vary the initial density over four orders of magnitude and the turbulent velocity over a factor ten. In a companion paper, we investigate the dependence of this distribution on the gas thermodynamics.  Methods: We performed a series of hydrodynamical numerical simulations using adaptive mesh refinement, with special attention to numerical convergence. We also adapted an existing analytical model to the case of collapsing clouds by employing a density probability distribution function (PDF) ∝rho-1.5 instead of a lognormal distribution.  Results: Simulations and analytical model both show two support regimes, a thermally dominated regime and a turbulence-dominated regime. For the first regime, we infer that dN/d logM ∝ M0, while for the second regime, we obtain dN/d logM ∝ M-3/4. This is valid up to about ten times the mass of the first Larson core, as explained in the companion paper, leading to a peak of the mass spectrum at  0.2 M&sun;. From this point, the mass spectrum decreases with decreasing mass except for the most diffuse clouds, where disk fragmentation leads to the formation of objects down to the mass of the first Larson core, that is, to a few 10-2 M&sun;.  Conclusions: Although the mass spectra we obtain for the most compact clouds qualitatively resemble the observed initial mass function, the distribution exponent is shallower than the expected Salpeter exponent of - 1.35. Nonetheless, we observe a possible transition toward a slightly steeper value that is broadly compatible with the Salpeter exponent for masses above a few solar masses. This change in behavior is associated with the change in density PDF, which switches from a power-law to a lognormal distribution. Our results suggest that while gravitationally induced fragmentation could play an important role for low masses, it is likely the turbulently induced fragmentation that leads to the Salpeter exponent.},

	Abstract = {We have constructed the most comprehensive catalog of photometry and proper motions ever assembled for a globular cluster (GC). The core of omegaCen has been imaged over 650 times through WFC3's UVIS and IR channels for the purpose of detector calibration. There exist from 4 to over 60 exposures through each of 26 filters stretching continuously from F225W in the UV to F160W in the infrared. Furthermore, the 11 yr baseline between these data and a 2002 ACS survey has allowed us to more than double the proper-motion accuracy and triple the number of well-measured stars compared to our previous groundbreaking effort. This totally unprecedented complete spectral coverage of over 470,000 stars within the cluster's core, from the tip of the red giant branch down to the white dwarfs, provides the best astro-photometric observational database yet to understand the multiple-population phenomenon in any GC. In this first paper of the series, we describe in detail the data-reduction processes and deliver the astro-photometric catalog to the astronomical community.

	Abstract = {We take advantage of the exquisite quality of the Hubble Space Telescope 26-filter astro-photometric catalog of the core of omega Cen presented in the first paper of this series and the empirical differential-reddening correction presented in the second paper in order to distill the main sequence into its constituent populations. To this end, we restrict ourselves to the five most useful filters: the magic ``trio'' of F275W, F336W, and F438W, along with F606W and F814W. We develop a strategy for identifying color systems where different populations stand out most distinctly, then we isolate those populations and examine them in other filters where their subpopulations also come to light. In this way, we have identified at least 15 subpopulations, each of which has a distinctive fiducial curve through our five-dimensional photometric space. We confirm the MSa to be split into two subcomponents, and find that both the bMS and the rMS are split into three subcomponents. Moreover, we have discovered two additional MS groups: the MSd (which has three subcomponents) shares similar properties with the bMS, and the MSe (which has four subcomponents) has properties more similar to those of the rMS. We examine the fiducial curves together and use synthetic spectra to infer relative heavy-element, light-element, and helium abundances for the populations. Our findings show that the stellar populations and star formation history of omega Cen are even more complex than inferred previously. Finally, we provide as a supplement to the original catalog a list that identifies for each star which population it is most likely associated with.

	Abstract = {Current cosmological analyses, which use Type Ia supernova observations, combine supernova (SN) samples to expand the redshift range beyond that of a single sample and increase the overall sample size. The inhomogeneous photometric calibration between different SN samples is one of the largest systematic uncertainties of the cosmological parameter estimation. To place these different samples on a single system, analyses currently use observations of a small sample of very bright flux standards on the Hubble Space Telescope system. We propose a complementary method, called ``Supercal,'' in which we use measurements of secondary standards in each system, compare these to measurements of the same stars in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) system, and determine the offsets for each system relative to PS1, placing all SN observations on a single, consistent photometric system. PS1 has observed 3pi of the sky and has a relative calibration of better than 5 mmag (for ˜15 < griz < 21 mag), making it an ideal reference system. We use this process to recalibrate optical observations taken by the following SN samples: PS1, Supernova Legacy Survey, SDSS, CSP, and CfA1-4. We measure discrepancies on average of 10 mmag, but up to 35 mmag, in various optical passbands. We find that correcting for these differences changes the recovered values for the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, by an average of 2.6%. This change is roughly half the size of current statistical constraints on w. The size of this effect strongly depends on the error in the B - V calibration of the low-z surveys. The Supercal method will allow future analyses to tie past samples to the best calibrated sample.},

	Abstract = {The highly elliptical, 16-year-period orbit of the star S2 around the massive black hole candidate Sgr A* is a sensitive probe of the gravitational field in the Galactic centre. Near pericentre at 120 AU, ~1400 Schwarzschild radii, the star has an orbital speed of ~7650 km/s, such that the first-order effects of Special and General Relativity have now become detectable with current capabilities. Over the past 26 years, we have monitored the radial velocity and motion on the sky of S2, mainly with the SINFONI and NACO adaptive optics instruments on the ESO Very Large Telescope, and since 2016 and leading up to the pericentre approach in May 2018, with the four-telescope interferometric beam-combiner instrument GRAVITY. From data up to and including pericentre, we robustly detect the combined gravitational redshift and relativistic transverse Doppler effect for S2 of z ~ 200 km/s / c with different statistical analysis methods. When parameterising the post-Newtonian contribution from these effects by a factor f, with f = 0 and f = 1 corresponding to the Newtonian and general relativistic limits, respectively, we find from posterior fitting with different weighting schemes f = 0.90 +/- 0.09 (stat) +\- 0.15 (sys). The S2 data are inconsistent with pure Newtonian dynamics.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we report the discovery of a new late-B type unbound hyper-runaway star (LAMOST-HVS4) from the LAMOST spectroscopic surveys. According to its atmospheric parameters, it is either a B-type main sequence (MS) star or a blue horizontal branch (BHB) star. Its Galactocentric distance and velocity are 30.3 +/- 1.6 kpc and 586 +/- 7 km/s if it is an MS star, and they are 13.2 +/- 3.7 kpc and 590 +/- 7 km/s if a BHB star. We track its trajectories back, and find that the trajectories intersect with the Galactic disk and the Galactic center lies outside of the intersection region at the 3 sigma confidence level. We investigate a number of mechanisms that could be responsible for the ejection of the star, and find that it is probably ejected from the Galactic disk by supernova explosion or multiple-body interactions in dense young stellar clusters.},

@article{Kuhn:2018fq,
	Abstract = {The Gaia mission has opened a new window into the internal kinematics of young star clusters at the sub-km/s level, with implications for our understanding of how star clusters form and evolve. We use a sample of 28 clusters and associations with ages from $\sim$1-5 Myr, where cluster members are already known from previous X-ray, optical, and infrared studies. Proper motions from Gaia DR2 reveal that 70% of these clusters show signs of expansion, with typical expansion velocities of $\sim$0.5 km/s. Furthermore, in many expanding associations, there is a positive radial gradient in the expansion velocity. We consider NGC 6530 and the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) as prototypes for systems with and without expansion. Velocity dispersions among the sample clusters and associations range from $\sigma_{1D}=1$-3 km/s. NGC 6530 is gravitationally unbound, with $\sigma_{1D}=2.2\pm0.2$ km/s and expansion velocity 0.9 km/s, while the denser ONC is consistent with virial equilibrium, having $\sigma_{1D}=1.8\pm0.1$ km/s and a Gaussian velocity distribution. The ONC also has a nearly constant velocity dispersion as a function of radius, but another non-expanding cluster, NGC 6231, has a velocity dispersion that decreases with radius. For those star-forming regions that contain multiple clusters or subclusters, we examine the kinematics of the individual groups and find that there is no evidence for ongoing coalescence of these groups. We compare our results to a cluster formation simulation, and comment on the implications for cluster assembly and the role of gas expulsion in cluster dissipation.},

	Abstract = {We have performed fully self-consistent N-body simulations of star clusters near the Galactic center (GC). Such simulations have not been previously performed, because it is difficult to generate fast and accurate simulations of these systems using conventional methods. We used the Bridge code, which integrates the parent galaxy using a tree algorithm and the star cluster using a fourth-order Hermite scheme with individual time steps. The interaction between the parent galaxy and the star cluster is calculate with a tree algorithm. Therefore, the Bridge code can handle both the orbital and internal evolution of star clusters correctly at the same time. We here investigate the evolution of star clusters using the Bridge code, and compare the results with previous studies. We find that (1) the inspiral timescale of the star clusters is shorter than that obtained with "traditional" simulations, in which the orbital evolution of star clusters is calculated analytically using the dynamical friction formula, and (2) core collapse of the star cluster increases the core density and helps the cluster to survive. The initial conditions of star clusters are not so severe as previously suggested.},

	Abstract = {Line-of-sight kinematic studies indicate that many Galactic globular clusters have a significant degree of internal rotation. However, three-dimensional kinematics from a combination of proper motions and line-of-sight velocities are needed to unveil the role of angular momentum in the formation and evolution of these old stellar systems. Here we present the first quantitative study of internal rotation on the plane-of-the-sky for a large sample of globular clusters using proper motions from Gaia DR2. We detect signatures of rotation in the tangential component of proper motions for 11 out of 51 clusters at a $>$3-sigma confidence level, confirming the detection reported in Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018 for 8 clusters. Moreover, we construct the two-dimensional rotation maps and proper motion rotation curves, and we assess the relevance of rotation with respect to random motions ($V/\sigma\sim0.08-0.53$). We find evidence of a correlation between the degree of internal rotation and relaxation time, highlighting the importance of long-term dynamical evolution in shaping the clusters current properties. This is a strong indication that angular momentum must have played a fundamental role in the earliest phases of cluster formation. Finally, exploiting the spatial information of the rotation maps and a comparison with line-of-sight data, we provide an estimate of the inclination of the rotation axis for a subset of 8 clusters. Our work demonstrates the potential of Gaia data for internal kinematic studies of globular clusters and provides the first step to reconstruct their intrinsic three-dimensional structure.},

	Abstract = {We study the core mass function (CMF) within 32 dense clumps in seven infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) via 1.3~mm continuum emission at a resolution of $\sim$1". We have identified 107 cores with the dendrogram algorithm, with a median radius of about 0.02 pc. Their masses range from 0.261 to 178 $M_{\odot}$. After applying completeness corrections, we fit the combined IRDC CMF with a power law of the form $d N / d\:{\rm log} M \propto M^{-\alpha}$ and derive an index of $\alpha\simeq0.86\pm0.11$ for $M \geq 0.79\:M_\odot$ and $\alpha\simeq0.70\pm0.13$ for $M\geq 1.26\:M_\odot$, which is a significantly more top-heavy distribution than the Salpeter stellar initial mass function (IMF) index of 1.35. We also make a direct comparison of these IRDC clump CMF results to those measured in the more evolved protocluster G286 derived with similar methods, which have $\alpha\simeq1.29\pm0.19$ and $1.08\pm0.27$ in these mass ranges, respectively. These results provide a hint that, especially for the $M\geq 1.26\:M_\odot$ range where completeness corrections are modest, the CMF in high pressure, early-stage environments of IRDC clumps may be top-heavy compared to that in the more evolved, global environment of the G286 protoclusters. However, larger samples of cores probing these different environments are needed to better establish the robustness of this potential CMF variation.},

	Abstract = {The Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project (HTTP) has provided an unprecedented photometric coverage of the entire star-burst region of 30 Doradus down to the half Solar mass limit. We use the deep stellar catalogue of HTTP to identify all the pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars of the region, i.e., stars that have not started their lives on the main-sequence yet. The photometric distinction of these stars from the more evolved populations is not a trivial task due to several factors that alter their colour-magnitude diagram positions. The identification of PMS stars requires, thus, sophisticated statistical methods. We employ Machine Learning Classification techniques on the HTTP survey of more than 800,000 sources to identify the PMS stellar content of the observed field. Our methodology consists of 1) carefully selecting the most probable low-mass PMS stellar population of the star-forming cluster NGC2070, 2) using this sample to train classification algorithms to build a predictive model for PMS stars, and 3) applying this model in order to identify the most probable PMS content across the entire Tarantula Nebula. We employ Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers to categorise the stars as PMS and Non-PMS. The Random Forest and Support Vector Machine provided the most accurate models, predicting about 20,000 sources with a candidateship probability higher than 50 percent, and almost 10,000 PMS candidates with a probability higher than 95 percent. This is the richest and most accurate photometric catalogue of extragalactic PMS candidates across the extent of a whole star-forming complex.},

@article{Barnes:2017db,
	Abstract = {The inner few hundred parsecs of the Milky Way harbours gas densities, pressures, velocity dispersions, an interstellar radiation field and a cosmic ray ionization rate orders of magnitude higher than the disc; akin to the environment found in star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Previous studies have shown that this region is forming stars at a rate per unit mass of dense gas which is at least an order of magnitude lower than in the disc, potentially violating theoretical predictions. We show that all observational star formation rate diagnostics - both direct counting of young stellar objects and integrated light measurements - are in agreement within a factor two, hence the low star formation rate (SFR) is not the result of the systematic uncertainties that affect any one method. As these methods trace the star formation over different time-scales, from 0.1 to 5 Myr, we conclude that the SFR has been constant to within a factor of a few within this time period. We investigate the progression of star formation within gravitationally bound clouds on ˜parsec scales and find 1-4 per cent of the cloud masses are converted into stars per free-fall time, consistent with a subset of the considered 'volumetric' star formation models. However, discriminating between these models is obstructed by the current uncertainties on the input observables and, most importantly and urgently, by their dependence on ill-constrained free parameters. The lack of empirical constraints on these parameters therefore represents a key challenge in the further verification or falsification of current star formation theories.},

	Abstract = {The Quintuplet is one of the most massive galactic clusters known, but appears to host a diverse stellar population that is difficult to reconcile with an instantaneous formation event. We present HST photometry and VLT spectroscopy in order to improve observational constraints, finding the Quintuplet to be far more homogeneous than previously thought. O7-8 Ia and O9-B0 Ia supergiants form a smooth morphological sequence with a cohort of seven early-B hypergiants and six luminous blue variables and WN9-11h stars, which together comprise the richest population of such stars of any known stellar aggregate. No further H-free Wolf-Rayets were found, resulting in a 13:1 ratio for WC/WN stars. However a small population of late-O hypergiants and WN8-9ha stars was identified, while a subset of the supergiants are unexpectedly faint, suggesting they are both less massive and older than the greater cluster population. We find an impressive coincidence between cluster members preceding the H-free WR phase and the evolutionary predictions for a 60Msun star, suggesting an age of ~3.0-3.6Myr for the Quintuplet. Neither the late-O hypergiants nor the low luminosity supergiants are predicted; we suggest that the former either result from rapid rotators or are the products of binary driven mass-stripping, while the latter may be interlopers. The H-free WRs must have had initial masses >60Msun, but it is difficult to reconcile their observational properties with theoretical expectations. Since the WRs represent an evolutionary phase directly preceding core-collapse, they are are crucial to understanding both this process and the nature of the resultant relativistic remnants, providing unique constraints on the evolution and death of the most massive stars forming in the local, high metallicity Universe (Abridged).},

	Abstract = {Context. The Galactic centre (GC) is of fundamental astrophysical interest, but existing near-infrared surveys fall short covering it adequately, either in terms of angular resolution, multi-wavelength coverage, or both. Here we introduce the GALACTICNUCLEUS survey, a JHKs imaging survey of the centre of the Milky Way with a 0.2" angular resolution. Aim. The purpose of this paper is to present the observations of Field 1 of our survey, centred approximately on SgrA* with an approximate size of 7.95' × 3.43'. We describe the observational set-up and data reduction pipeline and discuss the quality of the data. Finally, we present the analysis of the data.  Methods: The data were acquired with the near-infrared camera High Acuity Wide field K-band Imager (HAWK-I) at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). Short readout times in combination with the speckle holography algorithm allowed us to produce final images with a stable, Gaussian PSF (point spread function) of 0.2" FWHM (full width at half maximum). Astrometric calibration is achieved via the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey and photometric calibration is based on the SIRIUS/Infrared Survey Facility telescope (IRSF) survey. The quality of the data is assessed by comparison between observations of the same field with different detectors of HAWK-I and at different times.  Results: We reach 5sigma detection limits of approximately J = 22, H = 21, and Ks = 20. The photometric uncertainties are less than 0.05 at J ≲ 20, H ≲ 17, and Ks ≲ 16. We can distinguish five stellar populations in the colour-magnitude diagrams; three of them appear to belong to foreground spiral arms, and the other two correspond to high- and low-extinction star groups at the GC. We use our data to analyse the near-infrared extinction curve and find some evidence for a possible difference between the extinction index between J - H and H - Ks. However, we conclude that it can be described very well by a power law with an index of alphaJHKs = 2.30 $\pm$ 0.08. We do not find any evidence that this index depends on the position along the line of sight, or on the absolute value of the extinction. We produce extinction maps that show the clumpiness of the ISM (interstellar medium) at the GC. Finally, we estimate that the majority of the stars have solar or super-solar metallicity by comparing our extinction-corrected colour-magnitude diagrams with isochrones with different metallicities and a synthetic stellar model with a constant star formation.  Extinction maps as well as their corresponding uncertainty maps (Figs. 28, 30 and 31) are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (http://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/610/A83},

	Abstract = {We present results from the analysis of 401 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) belonging to the field of the Milky Way (MW), for which multiband (V, Ks, W1) photometry, metal abundances, extinction values and pulsation periods are available in the literature and accurate trigonometric parallaxes measured by the Gaia mission have become available with the Gaia second data release (DR2) on 2018 April 25. Using a Bayesian fitting approach we derive new near- and mid-infrared period-absolute magnitude-metallicity (PMZ) relations and new absolute visual magnitude-metallicity (Mv - [Fe/H]) relations based on the Gaia DR2 parallaxes of these 401 RRLs. We find the dependence of luminosity on metallicity to be higher than usually found in the literature, irrespective of the passband considered. Running the adopted Bayesian model on a simulated dataset we show that the high metallicity dependence is not caused by the method, but likely arises from the actual distribution of the data and the presence of a zero-point offset in the Gaia parallaxes. We infer a zero-point offset of -0.056 mas, with the Gaia DR2 parallaxes being systematically smaller. This value is in excellent agreement with the offset found by the Gaia validation team using a different sample of RRLs. In order to gauge our newly derived relations we use them to infer the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, which turns out to be in a good agreement with values currently adopted in the literature.},

	Abstract = {The most accurate measurements of magnetic fields in star-forming gas are based on the Zeeman observations analysed by Crutcher et al. We show that their finding that the 3D magnetic field scales approximately as density0.65 can also be obtained from analysis of the observed line-of-sight fields. We present two large-scale adaptive-mesh-refinement magnetohydrodynamic simulations of several thousand M&sun; of turbulent, isothermal, self-gravitating gas, one with a strong initial magnetic field (Alfv{\'e}n Mach number M_A,0=1) and one with a weak initial field (M_A,0=10). We construct samples of the 100 most massive clumps in each simulation and show that they exhibit a power-law relation between field strength and density (bar{n}_H) in excellent agreement with the observed one. Our results imply that the average field in molecular clumps in the interstellar medium (ISM) is < B_tot(bar{n}_H) > ≈ 42 bar{n}_{H, 4}^{0.65} mu G. Furthermore, the median value of the ratio of the line-of-sight field to density0.65 in the simulations is within a factor of about (1.3, 1.7) of the observed value for the strong- and weak-field cases, respectively. The median value of the mass-to-flux ratio, normalized to the critical value, is 70 per cent of the line-of-sight value. This is larger than the 50 per cent usually cited for spherical clouds because the actual mass-to-flux ratio depends on the volume-weighted field, whereas the observed one depends on the mass-weighted field. Our results indicate that the typical molecular clump in the ISM is significantly supercritical (˜ factor of 3). The results of our strong-field model are in very good quantitative agreement with the observations of Li et al., which show a strong correlation in field orientation between small and large scales. Because there is a negligible correlation in the weak-field model, we conclude that molecular clouds form from strongly magnetized (although magnetically supercritical) gas, in agreement with the conclusion of Li et al.},

	Abstract = {We present three ORION simulations of star cluster formation in a 1000 M&sun;, turbulent molecular cloud clump, including the effects of radiative transfer, protostellar outflows, and magnetic fields. Our simulations all use self-consistent turbulent initial conditions and vary the mean mass-to-flux ratio relative to the critical value over muPhi = 2, muPhi = 10, and muPhi = ∞ to gauge the influence of magnetic fields on star cluster formation. We find, in good agreement with previous studies, that magnetic fields corresponding to muPhi = 2 lower the star formation rate by a factor of ≈2.4 and reduce the amount of fragmentation by a factor of ≈2 relative to the zero-field case. We also find that the field increases the characteristic sink particle mass, again by a factor of ≈2.4. The magnetic field also increases the degree of clustering in our simulations, such that the maximum stellar densities in the muPhi = 2 case are higher than the others by again a factor of ≈2. This clustering tends to encourage the formation of multiple systems, which are more common in the rad-MHD runs than the rad-hydro run. The companion frequency in our simulations is consistent with observations of multiplicity in Class I sources, particularly for the muPhi = 2 case. Finally, we find evidence of primordial mass segregation in our simulations reminiscent of that observed in star clusters like the Orion Nebula Cluster.},

@article{Hocuk:2012bk,
	Abstract = {Star formation in the centers of galaxies is thought to yield massive stars with a possibly top-heavy stellar mass distribution. It is likely that magnetic fields play a crucial role in the distribution of stellar masses inside star-forming molecular clouds. In this context, we explore the effects of magnetic fields, with a typical field strength of 38 muG, such as in RCW 38, and a field strength of 135 muG, similar to NGC 2024 and the infrared dark cloud G28.34+0.06, on the initial mass function (IMF) near (<= 10 pc) a 107 solar mass black hole. Using these conditions, we perform a series of numerical simulations with the hydrodynamical code FLASH to elucidate the impact of magnetic fields on the IMF and the star-formation efficiency (SFE) emerging from an 800 solar mass cloud. We find that the collapse of a gravitationally unstable molecular cloud is slowed down with increasing magnetic field strength and that stars form along the field lines. The total number of stars formed during the simulations increases by a factor of 1.5-2 with magnetic fields. The main component of the IMF has a lognormal shape, with its peak shifted to sub-solar (<= 0.3 M&sun;) masses in the presence of magnetic fields, due to a decrease in the accretion rates from the gas reservoir. In addition, we see a top-heavy, nearly flat IMF above ~2 solar masses, from regions that were supported by magnetic pressure until high masses are reached. We also consider the effects of X-ray irradiation if the central black hole is active. X-ray feedback inhibits the formation of sub-solar masses and decreases the SFEs even further. Thus, the second contribution is no longer visible. We conclude that magnetic fields potentially change the SFE and the IMF both in active and inactive galaxies, and need to be taken into account in such calculations. The presence of a flat component of the IMF would be a particularly relevant signature for the importance of magnetic fields, as it is usually not found in hydrodynamical simulations.},

@article{Krumholz:2016bq,
	Abstract = {As star-forming clouds collapse, the gas within them fragments to ever-smaller masses. Naively one might expect this process to continue down to the smallest mass that is able to radiate away its binding energy on a dynamical time-scale, the opacity limit for fragmentation, at ˜0.01 M&sun;. However, the observed peak of the initial mass function (IMF) lies a factor of 20-30 higher in mass, suggesting that some other mechanism halts fragmentation before the opacity limit is reached. In this paper we analyse radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star cluster formation in typical Milky Way environments in order to determine what physical process limits fragmentation in them. We examine the regions in the vicinity of stars that form in the simulations to determine the amounts of mass that are prevented from fragmenting by thermal and magnetic pressure. We show that, on small scales, thermal pressure enhanced by stellar radiation heating is the dominant mechanism limiting the ability of the gas to further fragment. In the brown dwarf mass regime, ˜0.01 M&sun;, the typical object that forms in the simulations is surrounded by gas whose mass is several times its own that is unable to escape or fragment, and instead is likely to accrete. This mechanism explains why ˜0.01 M&sun; objects are rare: unless an outside agent intervenes (e.g. a shock strips away the gas around them), they will grow by accreting the warmed gas around them. In contrast, by the time stars grow to masses of ˜0.2 M&sun;, the mass of heated gas is only tens of percent of the central star mass, too small to alter its final mass by a large factor. This naturally explains why the IMF peak is at ˜0.2 M&sun;.},

	Abstract = {Context. Stars, and more particularly massive stars, have a drastic impact on galaxy evolution. Yet the conditions in which they form and collapse are still not fully understood.  Aims: In particular, the influence of the magnetic field on the collapse of massive clumps is relatively unexplored, it is therefore of great relevance in the context of the formation of massive stars to investigate its impact.  Methods: We perform high resolution, MHD simulations of the collapse of one hundred solar masses, turbulent and magnetized clouds, with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. We compute various quantities such as mass distribution, magnetic field, and angular momentum within the collapsing core and study the episodic outflows and the fragmentation that occurs during the collapse.  Results: The magnetic field has a drastic impact on the cloud evolution. We find that magnetic braking is able to substantially reduce the angular momentum in the inner part of the collapsing cloud. Fast and episodic outflows are being launched with typical velocities of the order of 1-3 km s-1, although the highest velocities can be as high as 20-40 km s-1. The fragmentation in several objects is reduced in substantially magnetized clouds with respect to hydrodynamical ones by a factor of the order of 1.5-2.  Conclusions: We conclude that magnetic fields have a significant impact on the evolution of massive clumps. In combination with radiation, magnetic fields largely determine the outcome of massive core collapse. We stress that numerical convergence of MHD collapse is a challenging issue. In particular, numerical diffusion appears to be important at high density and therefore could possibly lead to an overestimation of the number of fragments.},

	Abstract = {We present a set of three-dimensional, radiation-magnetohydrodynamic calculations of the gravitational collapse of massive (300 M &sun;), star-forming molecular cloud cores. We show that the combined effects of magnetic fields and radiative feedback strongly suppress core fragmentation, leading to the production of single-star systems rather than small clusters. We find that the two processes are efficient at suppressing fragmentation in different regimes, with the feedback most effective in the dense, central region and the magnetic field most effective in more diffuse, outer regions. Thus, the combination of the two is much more effective at suppressing fragmentation than either one considered in isolation. Our work suggests that typical massive cores, which have mass-to-flux ratios of about 2 relative to critical, likely form a single-star system, but that cores with weaker fields may form a small star cluster. This result helps us understand why the observed relationship between the core mass function and the stellar initial mass function holds even for ~100 M &sun; cores with many thermal Jeans masses of material. We also demonstrate that a ~40 AU Keplerian disk is able to form in our simulations, despite the braking effect caused by the strong magnetic field.},

	Abstract = {Star formation in a filamentary infrared dark cloud (IRDC) is simulated over the dynamic range of 4.2 pc to 28 au for a period of 3.5 × 105 yr, including magnetic fields and both radiative and outflow feedback from the protostars. At the end of the simulation, the star formation efficiency is 4.3 per cent and the star formation rate per free-fall time is epsiloff ~= 0.04, within the range of observed values. The total stellar mass increases as ~t2, whereas the number of protostars increases as ~t1.5. We find that the density profile around most of the simulated protostars is ~rho ∝ r-1.5. At the end of the simulation, the protostellar mass function approaches the Chabrier stellar initial mass function. We infer that the time to form a star of median mass 0.2 M&sun; is about 1.4 × 105 yr from the median mass accretion rate. We find good agreement among the protostellar luminosities observed in the large sample of Dunham et al., our simulation and a theoretical estimate, and we conclude that the classical protostellar luminosity problem is resolved. The multiplicity of the stellar systems in the simulation agrees, to within a factor of 2, with observations of Class I young stellar objects; most of the simulated multiple systems are unbound. Bipolar protostellar outflows are launched using a subgrid model, and extend up to 1 pc from their host star. The mass-velocity relation of the simulated outflows is consistent with both observation and theory.},

@article{Peters:2011hw,
	Abstract = {Massive stars disproportionately influence their surroundings. How they form has only started to become clear recently through radiation gas dynamical simulations. However, until now, no simulation has simultaneously included both magnetic fields and ionizing radiation. Here we present the results from the first radiation-magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulation including ionization feedback, comparing an RMHD model of a 1000 M sun rotating cloud to earlier radiation gas dynamical models with the same initial density and velocity distributions. We find that, despite starting with a strongly supercritical mass-to-flux ratio, the magnetic field has three effects. First, the field offers locally support against gravitational collapse in the accretion flow, substantially reducing the amount of secondary fragmentation in comparison to the gas dynamical case. Second, the field drains angular momentum from the collapsing gas, further increasing the amount of material available for accretion by the central, massive, protostar, and thus increasing its final mass by about 50% from the purely gas dynamical case. Third, the field is wound up by the rotation of the flow, driving a tower flow. However, this flow never achieves the strength seen in low-mass star formation simulations for two reasons: gravitational fragmentation disrupts the circular flow in the central regions where the protostars form, and the expanding H II regions tend to further disrupt the field geometry. Therefore, ionizing radiation is likely to dominate outflow dynamics in regions of massive star formation.},

	Abstract = {We present a large suite of simulations of the formation of low-mass star clusters. Our simulations include an extensive set of physical processes - magnetohydrodynamics, radiative transfer, and protostellar outflows - and span a wide range of virial parameters and magnetic field strengths. Comparing the outcomes of our simulations to observations, we find that simulations remaining close to virial balance throughout their history produce star formation efficiencies and initial mass function (IMF) peaks that are stable in time and in reasonable agreement with observations. Our results indicate that small-scale dissipation effects near the protostellar surface provide a feedback loop for stabilizing the star formation efficiency. This is true regardless of whether the balance is maintained by input of energy from large-scale forcing or by strong magnetic fields that inhibit collapse. In contrast, simulations that leave virial balance and undergo runaway collapse form stars too efficiently and produce an IMF that becomes increasingly top heavy with time. In all cases, we find that the competition between magnetic flux advection towards the protostar and outward advection due to magnetic interchange instabilities, and the competition between turbulent amplification and reconnection close to newly formed protostars renders the local magnetic field structure insensitive to the strength of the large-scale field, ensuring that radiation is always more important than magnetic support in setting the fragmentation scale and thus the IMF peak mass. The statistics of multiple stellar systems are similarly insensitive to variations in the initial conditions and generally agree with observations within the range of statistical uncertainty.},

@article{Price:2007lk,
	Abstract = {We have performed magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of molecular cloud cores using a new algorithm for MHD within the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method that enforces the zero magnetic divergence constraint. We find that the support provided by magnetic fields over thermal pressure alone has several important effects on fragmentation and the formation of binary and multiple systems, and on the properties of massive circumstellar discs. The extra support suppresses the tendency of molecular cloud cores to fragment due to either initial density perturbations or disc fragmentation. Furthermore, unlike most previous studies, we find that magnetic pressure plays the dominant role in inhibiting fragmentation rather than magnetic tension or magnetic braking. In particular, we find that if the magnetic field is aligned with the rotation axis of the molecular cloud core, the effects of the magnetic field on fragmentation and disc structure are almost entirely due to magnetic pressure, while if the rotation axis is initially perpendicular to the magnetic field, magnetic tension plays a greater role and can actually aid fragmentation. Despite these effects, and contrary to several past studies, we find that strongly perturbed molecular cloud cores are able to fragment to form wide binary systems even in the presence of quite strong magnetic fields. For massive circumstellar discs, we find that slowing of the collapse caused by the magnetic support decreases the mass infall rate on to the disc and, thus, weakens gravitational instabilities in young massive circumstellar discs. This not only reduces the likelihood that they will fragment, but also decreases the importance of spiral density waves in providing angular momentum transport and in promoting planet formation.},

	Abstract = {Powerful jets and outflows are launched from the protostellar disks around newborn stars. These outflows carry enough mass and momentum to transform the structure of their parent molecular cloud and to potentially control star formation itself. Despite their importance, we have not been able to fully quantify the impact of jets and outflows during the formation of a star cluster. The main problem lies in limited computing power. We would have to resolve the magnetic jet-launching mechanism close to the protostar and at the same time follow the evolution of a parsec-size cloud for a million years. Current computer power and codes fall orders of magnitude short of achieving this. In order to overcome this problem, we implement a subgrid-scale (SGS) model for launching jets and outflows, which demonstrably converges and reproduces the mass, linear and angular momentum transfer, and the speed of real jets, with ~1000 times lower resolution than would be required without the SGS model. We apply the new SGS model to turbulent, magnetized star cluster formation and show that jets and outflows (1) eject about one-fourth of their parent molecular clump in high-speed jets, quickly reaching distances of more than a parsec, (2) reduce the star formation rate by about a factor of two, and (3) lead to the formation of ~1.5 times as many stars compared to the no-outflow case. Most importantly, we find that jets and outflows reduce the average star mass by a factor of ~ three and may thus be essential for understanding the characteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function.},

	Abstract = {Star formation is inefficient. Only a few per cent of the available gas in molecular clouds forms stars, leading to the observed low star formation rate (SFR). The same holds when averaged over many molecular clouds, such that the SFR of whole galaxies is again surprisingly low. Indeed, considering the low temperatures, molecular clouds should be highly gravitationally unstable and collapse on their global mean freefall time-scale. And yet, they are observed to live about 10-100 times longer, i.e. the SFR per freefall time (SFRff) is only a few per cent. Thus, other physical mechanisms must counteract the quick global collapse. Turbulence, magnetic fields and stellar feedback have been proposed as regulating agents, but it is still unclear which of these processes is the most important and what their relative contributions are. Here, we run high-resolution simulations including gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields and jet/outflow feedback. We confirm that clouds collapse on a mean freefall time, if only gravity is considered, producing stars at an unrealistic rate. In contrast, if turbulence, magnetic fields and feedback are included step-by-step, the SFR is reduced by a factor of 2-3 with each additional physical ingredient. When they all act in concert, we find a constant SFRff = 0.04, currently the closest match to observations, but still about a factor of 2-4 higher than the average. A detailed comparison with other simulations and with observations leads us to conclude that only models with turbulence producing large virial parameters, and including magnetic fields and feedback can produce realistic SFRs.},

@article{Krumholz:2008ml,
	Abstract = {Massive stars are very rare, but their extreme luminosities make them both the only type of young star we can observe in distant galaxies and the dominant energy sources in the Universe today. They form rarely because efficient radiative cooling keeps most star-forming gas clouds close to isothermal as they collapse, and this favours fragmentation into stars of one solar mass or lower. Heating of a cloud by accreting low-mass stars within it can prevent fragmentation and allow formation of massive stars, but the necessary properties for a cloud to form massive stars-and therefore where massive stars form in a galaxy-have not yet been determined. Here we show that only clouds with column densities of at least 1gcm-2 can avoid fragmentation and form massive stars. This threshold, and the environmental variation of the stellar initial mass function that it implies, naturally explain the characteristic column densities associated with massive star clusters and the difference between the radial profiles of Halpha and ultraviolet emission in galactic disks. The existence of a threshold also implies that the initial mass function should show detectable variation with environment within the Galaxy, that the characteristic column densities of clusters containing massive stars should vary between galaxies, and that star formation rates in some galactic environments may have been systematically underestimated.},

	Abstract = {We derive hydrostatic, radiative equilibrium models for passive disks surrounding T Tauri stars. Each disk is encased by an optically thin layer of superheated dust grains. This layer reemits directly to space about half the stellar energy it absorbs. The other half is emitted inward and regulates the interior temperature of the disk. The heated disk flares. As a consequence, it absorbs more stellar radiation, especially at large radii, than a flat disk would. The portion of the spectral energy distribution contributed by the disk is fairly flat throughout the thermal infrared. At fixed frequency, the contribution from the surface layer exceeds that from the interior by about a factor 3 and is emitted at more than an order of magnitude greater radius. Spectral features from dust grains in the superheated layer appear in emission if the disk is viewed nearly face-on.},

	Abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are the sites of planet formation, and the evolution and eventual dispersal of these disks strongly influences the formation of planetary systems. Disk evolution during the planet-forming epoch is driven by accretion and mass loss due to winds, and in typical environments photoevaporation by high-energy radiation from the central star is likely to dominate final gas disk dispersal. We present a critical review of current theoretical models, and discuss the observations that are used to test these models and inform our understanding of the underlying physics. We also discuss the role disk dispersal plays in shaping planetary systems, considering its influence on both the process(es) of planet formation and the architectures of planetary systems. We conclude by presenting a schematic picture of protoplanetary disk evolution and dispersal, and discussing prospects for future work.},

	Abstract = {As planets form and grow within gaseous protoplanetary disks, the mutual gravitational interaction between the disk and planet leads to the exchange of angular momentum and migration of the planet. We review current understanding of disk-planet interactions, focusing in particular on physical processes that determine the speed and direction of migration. We describe the evolution of low-mass planets embedded in protoplanetary disks and examine the influence of Lindblad and corotation torques as a function of the disk properties. The role of the disk in causing the evolution of eccentricities and inclinations is also discussed. We describe the rapid migration of intermediate-mass planets that may occur as a runaway process and examine the transition to gap formation and slower migration driven by the viscous evolution of the disk for massive planets. The roles and influence of disk self-gravity and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence are discussed in detail, as a function of the planet mass, as is the evolution of multiple planet systems. Finally, we address the question of how well global models of planetary formation that include migration are able to match observations of extrasolar planets.},

@article{Williams:2011oe,
	Abstract = {Flattened, rotating disks of cool dust and gas extending for tens to hundreds of astronomical units are found around almost all low-mass stars shortly after their birth. These disks generally persist for several million years, during which time some material accretes onto the star, some is lost through outflows and photoevaporation, and some condenses into centimeter- and larger-sized bodies or planetesimals. Through observations mainly at IR through millimeter wavelengths, we can determine how common disks are at different ages; measure basic properties including mass, size, structure, and composition; and follow their varied evolutionary pathways. In this way, we see the first steps toward exoplanet formation and learn about the origins of the Solar System. This review addresses observations of the outer parts, beyond 1 AU, of protoplanetary disks with a focus on recent IR and (sub)millimeter results and an eye to the promise of new facilities in the immediate future.},

@article{Anderson:2013bl,
	Abstract = {This paper explores the effects of FUV radiation fields from external stars on circumstellar disk evolution. Disks residing in young clusters can be exposed to extreme levels of FUV flux from nearby OB stars, and observations show that disks in such environments are being actively photoevaporated. Typical FUV flux levels can be factors of ~102-104 higher than the interstellar value. These fields are effective in driving mass loss from circumstellar disks because they act at large radial distance from the host star, i.e., where most of the disk mass is located, and where the gravitational potential well is shallow. We combine viscous evolution (an alpha-disk model) with an existing FUV photoevaporation model to derive constraints on disk lifetimes, and to determine disk properties as functions of time, including mass-loss rates, disk masses, and radii. We also consider the effects of X-ray photoevaporation from the host star using an existing model, and show that for disks around solar-mass stars, externally generated FUV fields are often the dominant mechanism in depleting disk material. For sufficiently large viscosities, FUV fields can efficiently photoevaporate disks over the entire range of parameter space. Disks with viscosity parameter alpha = 10-3 are effectively dispersed within 1-3 Myr for higher viscosities (alpha = 10-2) disks are dispersed within ~0.25-0.5 Myr. Furthermore, disk radii are truncated to less than ~100 AU, which can possibly affect the formation of planets. Our model predictions are consistent with the range of observed masses and radii of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster.},

As measured by their L'-band excesses, at least 58+/-5 per cent of the pre-main sequence objects (0.45 < M < 2Msolar) have circumstellar discs. By comparing this disc frequency with frequencies determined for regions where the pre-main sequence stars are subject to less ionizing radiation, we find no evidence that the harsher environment of NGC 6611 (approximately an order of magnitude more ionizing Lyman continuum radiation than the Trapezium cluster) significantly hastens the dissipation of circumstellar discs around solar mass stars.},

	Abstract = {Hubble Space Telescope images of proplyds in the Orion Nebula, as well as submillimeter/radio measurements, show that the dominant O7 star {theta }1Ori C photoevaporates nearby disks around pre-main-sequence stars. Theory predicts that massive stars photoevaporate disks within distances of the order of 0.1 pc. These findings suggest that young, OB-dominated massive H ii regions are inhospitable to the survival of protoplanetary disks and, subsequently, to the formation and evolution of planets. In the current work, we test this hypothesis using large samples of pre-main-sequence stars in 20 massive star-forming regions selected with X-ray and infrared photometry in the MYStIX survey. Complete disk destruction would lead to a deficit of cluster members with an excess in JHKS and Spitzer/IRAC bands in the vicinity of O stars. In four MYStIX regions containing O stars and a sufficient surface density of disk-bearing sources to reliably test for spatial avoidance, we find no evidence for the depletion of inner disks around pre-main-sequence stars in the vicinity of O-type stars, even very luminous O2-O5 stars. These results suggest that massive star-forming regions are not very hostile to the survival of protoplanetary disks and, presumably, to the formation of planets.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We study the dependence of protoplanetary disk evolution on stellar mass using a large sample of young stellar objects in nearby young star-forming regions.  Methods: We update the protoplanetary disk fractions presented in our recent work (Paper I of this series) derived for 22 nearby (<500 pc) associations between 1 and 100 Myr. We use a subsample of 1428 spectroscopically confirmed members to study the impact of stellar mass on protoplanetary disk evolution. We divide this sample into two stellar mass bins (2 M&sun; boundary) and two age bins (3 Myr boundary), and use infrared excesses over the photospheric emission to classify objects in three groups: protoplanetary disks, evolved disks, and diskless. The homogeneous analysis and bias corrections allow for a statistically significant inter-comparison of the obtained results.  Results: We find robust statistical evidence of disk evolution dependence with stellar mass. Our results, combined with previous studies on disk evolution, confirm that protoplanetary disks evolve faster and/or earlier around high-mass (>2 M&sun;) stars. We also find a roughly constant level of evolved disks throughout the whole age and stellar mass spectra.  Conclusions: We conclude that protoplanetary disk evolution depends on stellar mass. Such a dependence could have important implications for gas giant planet formation and migration, and could contribute to explaining the apparent paucity of hot Jupiters around high-mass stars.

	Abstract = {We present photometry at 3-24 mum for all known members of the Upper Scorpius association (tau ~ 11 Myr) based on all images of these objects obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We have used these data to identify the members that exhibit excess emission from circumstellar disks and estimate the evolutionary stages of these disks. Through this analysis, we have found ~50 new candidates for transitional, evolved, and debris disks. The fraction of members harboring inner primordial disks is <~ 10% for B-G stars (M > 1.2 M &sun;) and increases with later types to a value of ~25% at gsimM5 (M <~ 0.2 M &sun;), in agreement with the results of previous disk surveys of smaller samples of Upper Sco members. These data indicate that the lifetimes of disks are longer at lower stellar masses and that a significant fraction of disks of low-mass stars survive for at least ~10 Myr. Finally, we demonstrate that the distribution of excess sizes in Upper Sco and the much younger Taurus star-forming region (tau ~ 1 Myr) is consistent with the same, brief timescale for clearing of inner disks.},

Here we review our state of understanding of five fundamental bottlenecks in planet formation. These are the following: (1) the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks; (2) the growth of the first planetesimals; (3) orbital migration driven by interactions between protoplanets and gaseous disk; (4) the origin of the Solar System's orbital architecture; and (5) the relationship between observed super-Earths and our own terrestrial planets. Given our lack of understanding of these issues, even the most successful formation models remain on shaky ground.},

	Abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are quasi-steady structures whose evolution and dispersal determine the environment for planet formation. I review the theory of protoplanetary disk evolution and its connection to observations. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the physics of potential angular momentum transport processes---including self-gravity, magnetorotational instability, baroclinic instabilities, and magnetic braking---and in developing testable models for disk dispersal via photoevaporation. The relative importance of these processes depends upon the initial mass, size, and magnetization of the disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state, and external irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation, pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the early stages of planet formation and may vary dramatically from star to star. The importance of validating theoretical models is emphasized, with the key observations being those that probe disk structure on the scales between 1 AU and 10 AU, where theory is most uncertain.},

@article{Youdin:2005ud,
	Abstract = {Interpenetrating streams of solids and gas in a Keplerian disk produce a local, linear instability. The two components mutually interact via aerodynamic drag, which generates radial drift and triggers unstable modes. The secular instability does not require self-gravity, yet it generates growing particle-density perturbations that could seed planetesimal formation. Growth rates are slower than dynamical but faster than radial drift timescales. Growth rates, like streaming velocities, are maximized for marginal coupling (stopping times comparable to dynamical times). Fastest growth occurs when the solid-to-gas density ratio is order unity and feedback is strongest. Curiously, growth is strongly suppressed when the densities are too nearly equal. The relation between background drift and wave properties is explained by analogy with Howard's semicircle theorem. The three-dimensional, two-fluid equations describe a sixth-order (in the complex frequency) dispersion relation. A terminal velocity approximation allows simplification to an approximate cubic dispersion relation. To describe the simplest manifestation of this instability, we ignore complicating (but possibly relevant) factors such as vertical stratification, dispersion of particle sizes, turbulence, and self-gravity. We consider applications to planetesimal formation and compare our work to other studies of particle-gas dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Photometric detections of dust circumstellar disks around pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, coupled with estimates of stellar ages, provide constraints on the time available for planet formation. Most previous studies on disk longevity, starting with Haisch, Lada & Lada (2001), use star samples from PMS clusters but do not consider datasets with homogeneous photometric sensitivities and/or ages placed on a uniform timescale. Here we conduct the largest study to date of the longevity of inner dust disks using X-ray and 1-8 {mu m} infrared photometry from the MYStIX and SFiNCs projects for 69 young clusters in 32 nearby star-forming regions with ages t <= 5 Myr. Cluster ages are derived by combining the empirical AgeJX method with PMS evolutionary models, which treat dynamo-generated magnetic fields in different ways. Leveraging X-ray data to identify disk-free objects, we impose similar stellar mass sensitivity limits for disk-bearing and disk-free YSOs while extending the analysis to stellar masses as low as M ˜ 0.1 M&sun;. We find that the disk longevity estimates are strongly affected by the choice of PMS evolutionary model. Assuming a disk fraction of 100% at zero age, the inferred disk half-life changes significantly, from t1/2 ˜ 1.3 - 2 Myr to t1/2 ˜ 3.5 Myr when switching from non-magnetic to magnetic PMS models. In addition, we find no statistically significant evidence that disk fraction varies with stellar mass within the first few Myr of life for stars with masses <2 M&sun;, but our samples may not be complete for more massive stars. The effects of initial disk fraction and star-forming environment are also explored.},

	Abstract = {VLT/ISAAC JHKL photometry with subarcsecond resolution of the dense, massive starburst cluster NGC 3603 YC forming the core of the NGC 3603 giant molecular cloud is analyzed to reveal characteristics of the stellar population in unprecedented detail. The color-magnitude plane features a strong pre-main-sequence/main-sequence (PMS/MS) transition region, including the PMS/MS transition point, and reveals a secondary sequence for the first time in a nearby young starburst cluster. Arguments for a possible binary nature of this sequence are given. The resolved PMS/MS transition region allows isochrone fitting below the hydrogen-burning turn-on in NGC 3603 YC, yielding an independent estimate of global cluster parameters. A distance modulus of 13.9 mag, equivalent to d=6.0+/-0.3 kpc, is derived, as well as a line-of-sight extinction of AV=4.5+/-0.6 toward PMS stars in the cluster center. The interpretation of a binary candidate sequence suggests a single age of 1 Myr for NGC 3603 YC, providing evidence for a single burst of star formation without the need to employ an age spread in the PMS population, as argued for in earlier studies. Disk fractions are derived from L-band excesses, indicating a radial increase in the disk frequency from 20% to 40% from the core to the cluster outskirts. The low disk fraction in the cluster core, as compared to the 42% L-band excess fraction found for massive stars in the Trapezium cluster of a comparably young age, indicates strong photoevaporation in the cluster center. The estimated binary fraction of 30%, as well as the low disk fraction, suggest strong impacts on low-mass star formation due to stellar interactions in the dense starburst. The significant differences between NGC 3603 YC and less dense and massive young star clusters in the Milky Way reveal the importance of using local starbursts as templates for massive extragalactic star formation.  Based on observations obtained at the ESO VLT on Paranal, Chile, under programs 63.I-0015 and 65.I-0135, and data from the public VLT archive provided by ESO, as well as observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

Methods: .Deep {JHKL} imaging and K-band spectroscopy from the VLT of 201 stars toward the cluster is presented. Results: .The majority of 104 stars show the CO band-head in absorption. Half of them emit X-rays and/or have infrared excess, indicative of very young objects. Their intrinsic IR luminosity is compatible with intermediate and high-mass pre-main sequence stars. Nine additional stars have the CO feature in emission, while sixty sources are lacking any stellar spectral feature due to veiling by circumstellar dust. Conclusions: .We suggest that CO absorption is - as in the case of low-mass stars - also a common feature during the early evolution of stars with higher masses. According to model calculations the observed CO absorption is most likely a sign of heavily accreting protostars with mass accretion rates above 10-5 M_&sun; yr-1.},

	Abstract = {Context: .We present a JHKsL survey of the massive star forming region RCW 57 (NGC 3576) based on L-band data at 3.5 mum taken with SPIREX (South Pole Infrared Explorer), and 2MASS JHKs data at 1.25-2.2 mum. This is the second of two papers, the first one concerning a similar JHKsL survey of 30 Doradus. Aims: .Colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams are used to detect sources with infrared excess. This excess emission is interpreted as coming from circumstellar disks, and hence gives the cluster disk fraction (CDF). Based on the CDF and the age of RCW 57, it is possible to draw conclusions on the formation and early evolution of massive stars. Methods: .The infrared excess is detected by comparing the locations of sources in JHKsL colour-colour and L vs. (K_s-L) colour-magnitude diagrams to the reddening band due to interstellar extinction. Results: .A total of 251 sources were detected. More than 50% of the 209 sources included in the diagrams have an infrared excess. Conclusions: .Comparison with other JHKsL surveys, including the results on 30 Doradus from the first paper, support a very high initial disk fraction (>80%) even for massive stars, although there is an indication of a possible faster evolution of circumstellar disks around high mass stars. 33 sources only found in the L-band indicate the presence of heavily embedded, massive Class I protostars. We also report the detection of diffuse PAHs emission throughout the RCW 57 region.},

	Abstract = {Forming stars emit a substantial amount of radiation into their natal environment. We use ORION, an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) three-dimensional gravito-radiation-hydrodyanics code, to simulate low-mass star formation in a turbulent molecular cloud. We compare the distributions of stellar masses, accretion rates, and temperatures in the cases with and without radiative transfer, and we demonstrate that radiative feedback has a profound effect on accretion, multiplicity, and mass by reducing the number of stars formed and the total rate at which gas turns into stars. We also show that once the star formation reaches a steady state, protostellar radiation is by far the dominant source of energy in the simulation, exceeding viscous dissipation and compressional heating by at least an order of magnitude. Calculations that omit radiative feedback from protstars significantly underestimate the gas temperature and the strength of this effect. Although heating from protostars is mainly confined to the protostellar cores, we find that it is sufficient to suppress disk fragmentation that would otherwise result in very low-mass companions or brown dwarfs. We demonstrate that the mean protostellar accretion rate increases with the final stellar mass so that the star formation time is only a weak function of mass.},

	Abstract = {The presence of young massive stars orbiting on eccentric rings within a few tenths of a parsec of the supermassive black hole in the galactic center is challenging for theories of star formation. The high tidal shear from the black hole should tear apart the molecular clouds that form stars elsewhere in the Galaxy, and transport of stars to the galactic center also appears unlikely during their lifetimes. We conducted numerical simulations of the infall of a giant molecular cloud that interacts with the black hole. The transfer of energy during closest approach allows part of the cloud to become bound to the black hole, forming an eccentric disk that quickly fragments to form stars. Compressional heating due to the black hole raises the temperature of the gas up to several hundred to several thousand kelvin, ensuring that the fragmentation produces relatively high stellar masses. These stars retain the eccentricity of the disk and, for a sufficiently massive initial cloud, produce an extremely top-heavy distribution of stellar masses. This potentially repetitive process may explain the presence of multiple eccentric rings of young stars in the presence of a supermassive black hole.},

@article{Bonnell:2006os,
	Abstract = {We use numerical simulations of the fragmentation of a 1000Msolar molecular cloud and the formation of a stellar cluster to study how the initial conditions for star formation affect the resulting initial mass function (IMF). In particular, we are interested in the relation between the thermal Jeans mass in a cloud and the knee of the IMF, i.e. the mass separating the region with a flat IMF slope from that typified by a steeper, Salpeter-like, slope. In three isothermal simulations with MJeans= 1, 2 and 5Msolar, the number of stars formed, at comparable dynamical times, scales roughly with the number of initial Jeans masses in the cloud. The mean stellar mass also increases (though less than linearly) with the initial Jeans mass in the cloud. It is found that the IMF in each case displays a prominent knee, located roughly at the mass scale of the initial Jeans mass. Thus clouds with higher initial Jeans masses produce IMFs which are shallow to higher masses. This implies that a universal IMF requires a physical mechanism that sets the Jeans mass to be near 1Msolar. Simulations including a barotropic equation of state as suggested by Larson, with cooling at low densities followed by gentle heating at higher densities, are able to produce realistic IMFs with the knee located at ~1Msolar, even with an initial MJeans= 5Msolar. We therefore suggest that the observed universality of the IMF in the local Universe does not require any fine tuning of the initial conditions in star forming clouds but is instead imprinted by details of the cooling physics of the collapsing gas.},

@article{Padoan:2002tw,
	Abstract = {The morphology and kinematics of molecular clouds (MCs) are best explained as the consequence of supersonic turbulence. Supersonic turbulence fragments MCs into dense sheets, filaments, and cores and large low-density ``voids,'' via the action of highly radiative shocks. We refer to this process as turbulent fragmentation. In this work we derive the mass distribution of gravitationally unstable cores generated by the process of turbulent fragmentation. The mass distribution above 1 Msolar depends primarily on the power spectrum of the turbulent flow and on the jump conditions for isothermal shocks in a magnetized gas. For a power spectrum index beta=1.74, consistent with Larson's velocity dispersion-size relation as well as with new numerical and analytic results on supersonic turbulence, we obtain a power-law mass distribution of dense cores with a slope equal to 3/(4-beta)=1.33, consistent with the slope of the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Below 1 Msolar, the mass distribution flattens and turns around at a fraction of 1 Msolar, as observed for the stellar IMF in a number of stellar clusters, because only the densest cores are gravitationally unstable. The mass distribution at low masses is determined by the probability distribution of the gas density, which is known to be approximately lognormal for an isothermal turbulent gas. The intermittent nature of the turbulent density distribution is thus responsible for the existence of a significant number of small collapsing cores, even of substellar mass. Since turbulent fragmentation is unavoidable in supersonically turbulent molecular clouds, and given the success of the present model in predicting the observed shape of the stellar IMF, we conclude that turbulent fragmentation is essential to the origin of the stellar IMF.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the effect of radiative feedback on the star formation process using radiation hydrodynamical simulations. We repeat the previous hydrodynamical star cluster formation simulations of Bate et al. and Bate & Bonnell, but we use a realistic gas equation of state and radiative transfer in the flux-limited diffusion approximation rather than the original barotropic equation of state.  Whereas star formation in the barotropic simulations continued unabated until the simulations stopped, we find that radiative feedback, even from low-mass stars, were essentially terminates the production of new objects within low-mass dense molecular cloud cores after roughly one local dynamical time. Radiative feedback also dramatically decreases the propensity of massive circumstellar discs to fragment and inhibits fragmentation of other dense gas (e.g. filaments) close to existing protostellar objects. These two effects decrease the numbers of protostars formed by a factor of ~4 compared with the original hydrodynamical simulations using the barotropic equation of state. In particular, whereas the original simulations produced more brown dwarfs than stars, the radiative feedback results in a ratio of stars to brown dwarfs of approximately 5:1, in much better agreement with observations. Most importantly, we find that although the characteristic stellar mass in the original calculations scaled linearly with the initial mean Jeans mass in the clouds, when radiative feedback is included the characteristic stellar mass is indistinguishable for the two calculations, regardless of the initial Jeans mass of the clouds. We thus propose that the reason the observed initial mass function appears to be universal in the local Universe is due to self-regulation of the star formation process by radiative feedback. We present an analytic argument showing how a characteristic mass may be derived that is relatively independent of initial conditions such as the cloud's density.},

	Abstract = {One model for the origin of typical Galactic star clusters such as the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is that they form via the rapid, efficient collapse of a bound gas clump within a larger, gravitationally unbound giant molecular cloud. However, simulations in support of this scenario have thus far not included the radiation feedback produced by the stars; radiative simulations have been limited to significantly smaller or lower-density regions. Here we use the ORION AMR code to conduct the first ever radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the global collapse scenario for the formation of an ONC-like cluster. We show that radiative feedback has a dramatic effect on the evolution: once the first ~10%-20% of the gas mass is incorporated into stars, their radiative feedback raises the gas temperature high enough to suppress any further fragmentation. However, gas continues to accrete onto existing stars, and, as a result, the stellar mass distribution becomes increasingly top-heavy, eventually rendering it incompatible with the observed initial mass function (IMF). Systematic variation in the location of the IMF peak as star formation proceeds is incompatible with the observed invariance of the IMF between star clusters, unless some unknown mechanism synchronizes the IMFs in different clusters by ensuring that star formation is always truncated when the IMF peak reaches a particular value. We therefore conclude that the global collapse scenario, at least in its simplest form, is not compatible with the observed stellar IMF. We speculate that processes that slow down star formation, and thus reduce the accretion luminosity, may be able to resolve the problem.},

	Abstract = {We report a series of simulations of the formation of a star cluster similar to the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), including both radiative transfer and protostellar outflows, and starting from both smooth and self-consistently turbulent initial conditions. Each simulation forms >150 stars and brown dwarfs, yielding a stellar mass distribution that ranges from <0.1 M &sun; to >10 M &sun;. We show that a simulation that begins with self-consistently turbulent density and velocity fields embedded in a larger turbulent volume, and that includes protostellar outflows, produces an initial mass function (IMF) that is consistent both with that of the ONC and the Galactic field, at least within the statistical power provided by the number of stars formed in our simulations. This is the first simulation published to date that reproduces the observed IMF in a cluster large enough to contain massive stars, and where the peak of the mass function is determined by a fully self-consistent calculation of gas thermodynamics rather than a hand-imposed equation of state. This simulation also produces a star formation rate that, while still somewhat too high, is much closer to observed values than if we omit either the larger turbulent volume or the outflows. Moreover, we show that the combination of outflows, self-consistently turbulent initial conditions, and turbulence continually fed by motions on scales larger than that of the protocluster yields an IMF that is in agreement with observations and invariant with time, resolving the "overheating" problem in which simulations without these features have an IMF peak that shifts to progressively higher masses over time as more and more of the gas is heated, inconsistent with the observed invariance of the IMF. The simulation that matches the observed IMF also qualitatively reproduces the observed trend of stellar multiplicity strongly increasing with mass. We show that this simulation produces massive stars from distinct massive cores whose properties are consistent with those of observed massive cores. However, the stars formed in these cores also undergo dynamical interactions as they accrete that naturally produce Trapezium-like hierarchical multiple systems of massive stars.},

	Abstract = {It has been a longstanding problem to determine, as far as possible, the characteristic masses of stars in terms of fundamental constants; the almost complete invariance of this mass as a function of the star-forming environment suggests that this should be possible. Here I provide such a calculation. The typical stellar mass is set by the characteristic fragment mass in a star-forming cloud, which depends on the cloud's density and temperature structure. Except in the very early universe, the latter is determined mainly by the radiation released as matter falls onto seed protostars. The energy yield from this process is ultimately set by the properties of deuterium burning in protostellar cores, which determines the stars' radii. I show that it is possible to combine these considerations to compute a characteristic stellar mass almost entirely in terms of fundamental constants, with an extremely weak residual dependence on the interstellar pressure and metallicity. This result not only explains the invariance of stellar masses, it resolves a second mystery: why fragmentation of a cold, low-density interstellar cloud, a process with no obvious dependence on the properties of nuclear reactions, happens to select a stellar mass scale such that stellar cores can ignite hydrogen. Finally, the weak residual dependence on the interstellar pressure and metallicity may explain recent observational hints of a smaller characteristic mass in the high-pressure, high-metallicity cores of giant elliptical galaxies.},

@article{Guszejnov:2017fu,
	Abstract = {Stars are strongly clustered on both large (˜pc) and small (˜binary) scales, but there are few analytic or even semi-analytic theories for the correlation function and multiplicity of stars. In this paper, we present such a theory, based on our recently developed semi-analytic framework called MISFIT (Minimalistic Star Formation Including Turbulence), which models gravito-turbulent fragmentation, including the suppression of fragmentation by protostellar radiation feedback. We compare the results including feedback to a control model in which it is omitted. We show that both classes of models robustly reproduce the stellar correlation function at >0.01 pc scales, which is well approximated by a power law that follows generally from scale-free physics (turbulence plus gravity) on large scales. On smaller scales, protostellar disc fragmentation becomes dominant over common core fragmentation, leading to a steepening of the correlation function. Multiplicity is more sensitive to feedback: we found that a model with the protostellar heating reproduces the observed multiplicity fractions and mass ratio distributions for both Solar and sub-Solar mass stars (in particular, the brown dwarf desert), while a model without feedback fails to do so. The model with feedback also produces an at-formation period distribution consistent with the one inferred from observations. However, it is unable to produce short-range binaries below the length-scale of protostellar discs. We suggest that such close binaries are produced primarily by disc fragmentation and further decrease their separation through orbital decay.},

	Abstract = {Context: The dynamical escape of stars from star clusters affects the shape of the stellar mass function (MF) in these clusters, because the escape probability of a star depends on its mass. This is found in N-body simulations and has been approximated in analytical cluster models by fitting the evolution of the MF. Both approaches are naturally restricted to the set of boundary conditions for which the simulations were performed. Aims: The objective of this paper is to provide and to apply a simple physical model for the evolution of the MF in star clusters for a large range of the parameter space. It should also offer a new perspective on the results from N-body simulations. Methods: A simple, physically self-contained model for the evolution of the stellar MF in star clusters is derived from the basic principles of two-body encounters and energy considerations. It is independent of the adopted mass loss rate or initial mass function (IMF), and contains stellar evolution, stellar remnant retention, dynamical dissolution in a tidal field, and mass segregation. Results: The MF evolution in star clusters depends on the disruption time, remnant retention fraction, initial-final stellar mass relation, and IMF. Low-mass stars are preferentially ejected after t ~ 400 Myr. Before that time, masses around 15-20% of the maximum stellar mass are lost due to their rapid two-body relaxation with the massive stars that still exist at young ages. The degree of low-mass star depletion grows for increasing disruption times, but can be quenched when the retained fraction of massive remnants is large. The highly depleted MFs of certain Galactic globular clusters are explained by the enhanced low-mass star depletion that occurs for low remnant retention fractions. Unless the retention fraction is exceptionally large, dynamical evolution always decreases the mass-to-light ratio. The retention of black holes reduces the fraction of the cluster mass in remnants because white dwarfs and neutron stars have masses that are efficiently ejected by black holes. Conclusions: The modeled evolution of the MF is consistent with N-body simulations when adopting identical boundary conditions. However, it is found that the results from N-body simulations only hold for their specific boundary conditions and should not be generalised to all clusters. It is concluded that the model provides an efficient method to understand the evolution of the stellar MF in star clusters under widely varying conditions.

	Abstract = {The evolution of the global stellar mass function of star clusters is studied based on a large set of N-body simulations of clusters with a range of initial masses, initial concentrations, in circular or elliptical orbits in different tidal environments. Models with and without initial mass segregation are included. The depletion of low-mass stars in initially Roche-volume (tidal) filling clusters starts typically on a time-scale of the order of the core collapse time. In clusters that are initially underfilling their Roche-volume it takes longer because the clusters have to expand to their tidal radii before dynamical mass-loss becomes important.  We introduce the concept of the differential mass function (DMF), which describes the changes with respect to the initial mass function (IMF). We show that the evolution of the DMF can be described by a set of very simple analytic expressions that are valid for a wide range of initial cluster parameters and for different IMFs. The agreement between this description and the models is very good, except for initially Roche-volume underfilling clusters that are severely mass segregated.},

	Abstract = {We review recent advances in our understanding of the origin of the initial mass function (IMF). We emphasize the use of numerical simulations to investigate how each physical process involved in star formation affects the resulting IMF. We stress that it is insufficient to just reproduce the IMF, but that any successful model needs to account for the many observed properties of star-forming regions, including clustering, mass segregation, and binarity. Fragmentation involving the interplay of gravity, turbulence, and thermal effects is probably responsible for setting the characteristic stellar mass. Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs can form through the fragmentation of dense filaments and disks, possibly followed by early ejection from these dense environments, which truncates their growth in mass. Higher-mass stars and the Salpeter-like slope of the IMF are most likely formed through continued accretion in a clustered environment. The effects of feedback and magnetic fields on the origin of the IMF are still largely unclear. Finally, we discuss a number of outstanding problems that need to be addressed in order to develop a complete theory for the origin of the IMF.},

	Abstract = {Context. Understanding the origin of the initial mass function (IMF) of stars is a major problem for the star formation process and beyond. Aim. We investigate the dependence of the peak of the IMF on the physics of the so-called first Larson core, which corresponds to the point where the dust becomes opaque to its own radiation.  Methods: We performed numerical simulations of collapsing clouds of 1000 M&sun; for various gas equations of state (eos), paying great attention to the numerical resolution and convergence. The initial conditions of these numerical experiments are varied in the companion paper. We also develop analytical models that we compare to our numerical results.  Results: When an isothermal eos is used, we show that the peak of the IMF shifts to lower masses with improved numerical resolution. When an adiabatic eos is employed, numerical convergence is obtained. The peak position varies with the eos, and using an analytical model to infer the mass of the first Larson core, we find that the peak position is about ten times its value. By analyzing the stability of nonlinear density fluctuations in the vicinity of a point mass and then summing over a reasonable density distribution, we find that tidal forces exert a strong stabilizing effect and likely lead to a preferential mass several times higher than that of the first Larson core.  Conclusions: We propose that in a sufficiently massive and cold cloud, the peak of the IMF is determined by the thermodynamics of the high-density adiabatic gas as well as the stabilizing influence of tidal forces. The resulting characteristic mass is about ten times the mass of the first Larson core, which altogether leads to a few tenths of solar masses. Since these processes are not related to the large-scale physical conditions and to the environment, our results suggest a possible explanation for the apparent universality of the peak of the IMF.},

@article{Andre:2010la,
	Abstract = {We summarize the first results from the Gould Belt Survey, obtained toward the Aquila rift and Polaris Flare regions during the science demonstration phase of Herschel. Our 70-500 mum images taken in parallel mode with the SPIRE and PACS cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well as numerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. Between ~350 and 500 prestellar cores and ~45-60 Class 0 protostars can be identified in the Aquila field, while ~300 unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in the Polaris field. The prestellar core mass function (CMF) derived for the Aquila region bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (IMF), already confirming the close connection between the CMF and the IMF with much better statistics than earlier studies. Comparing and contrasting our Herschel results in Aquila and Polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenario for core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filaments form first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragment into a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.Appendix A and Figures 3, 4 are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

@article{Chabrier:2014oq,
	Abstract = {We examine variations of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in extreme environments within the formalism derived by Hennebelle & Chabrier. We focus on conditions encountered in progenitors of massive early-type galaxies and starburst regions. We show that, when applying the concept of turbulent Jeans mass as the characteristic mass for fragmentation in a turbulent medium, the peak of the IMF in such environments is shifted toward smaller masses, leading to a bottom-heavy IMF, as suggested by various observations. In very dense and turbulent environments, we predict that the high-mass tail of the IMF can become even steeper than the standard Salpeter IMF, with a limit for the power-law exponent alpha ~= -2.7, in agreement with recent observational determinations. This steepening is a direct consequence of the high densities and Mach values in such regions but also of the time dependence of the fragmentation process, as incorporated in the Hennebelle-Chabrier theory. We provide analytical parameterizations of these IMFs in such environments to be used in galaxy evolution calculations. We also calculate the star-formation rates and the mass-to-light ratios expected under such extreme conditions and show that they agree well with the values inferred in starburst environments and massive high-redshift galaxies. This reinforces the paradigm of star formation as being a universal process, i.e., the direct outcome of gravitationally unstable fluctuations in a density field initially generated by large-scale, shock-dominated turbulence. This globally enables us to infer the variations of the stellar IMF and related properties for atypical galactic conditions.},

@article{Hopkins:2012eu,
	Abstract = {Hennebelle & Chabrierattempted to derive the stellar initial mass function (IMF) as a consequence of lognormal density fluctuations in a turbulent medium, using an argument similar to Press & Schechter for Gaussian random fields. Like that example, however, the solution there does not resolve the 'cloud-in-cloud' problem; it also does not extend to the large scales that dominate the velocity and density fluctuations. In principle, these can change the results at the order-of-magnitude level or more. In this paper, we use the results from Hopkins to generalize the excursion set formalism and derive the exact solution in this regime. We argue that the stellar IMF and core mass function (CMF) should be associated with the last-crossing distribution, i.e. the mass spectrum of bound objects defined on the smallest scale on which they are self-gravitating. This differs from the first-crossing distribution (mass function on the largest self-gravitating scale) which is defined in cosmological applications and which, Hopkins shows, corresponds to the giant molecular cloud (GMC) mass function in discs. We derive an analytic equation for the last-crossing distribution that can be applied for an arbitrary collapse threshold shape in interstellar medium and cosmological studies. With this, we show that the same model that predicts the GMC mass function and large-scale structure of galaxy discs also predicts the CMF - and by extrapolation stellar IMF - in good agreement with observations. The only adjustable parameter in the model is the turbulent velocity power spectrum, which in the range ? gives similar results. We also use this to formally justify why the approximate solution in Hennebelle & Chabrier is reasonable (up to a normalization constant) over the mass range of the CMF/IMF; however, there are significant corrections at intermediate and high masses. We discuss how the exact solutions here can be used to predict additional quantities such as the clustering of stars, and embedded into time-dependent models that follow density fluctuations, fragmentation, mergers and successive generations of star formation.},

In the centre of the Milky Way, however, there are indications for strong deviations and the same may be true for the nuclei of distant starburst galaxies. Here we present the first numerical hydrodynamical calculations of stars formed in a molecular region with chemical and thermodynamic properties similar to those of warm and dusty circumnuclear starburst regions. The resulting initial mass function is top-heavy with a peak at ~15Msolar, a sharp turn-down below ~7Msolar and a power-law decline at high masses. We find a natural explanation for our results in terms of the temperature dependence of the Jeans mass, with collapse occurring at a temperature of ~100 K and an H2 density of a few ×105 cm-3, and discuss possible implications for galaxy formation and evolution.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of the stellar population and the present-day mass function (PDMF) of the Westerlund 2 (Wd2) region using the data from our high-resolution multiband survey with the Hubble Space Telescope. We used state-of-the-art artificial star tests to determine spatially resolved completeness maps for each of the broadband filters. We reach a level of completeness of 50% down to F555W=24.8 mag (0.7 {M}&sun; ) and F814W=23.3 mag (0.2 {M}&sun; ) in the optical and F125W=20.2 mag and F160W=19.4 mag (both 0.12 {M}&sun; ) in the infrared throughout the field of view. We had previously reported that the core of Wd2 consists of two clumps: namely the main cluster and the northern clump. From the spatial distribution of the completeness-corrected population, we find that their stellar surface densities are 1114 {stars} {{pc}}-2 and 555 {stars} {{pc}}-2, respectively, down to F814W=21.8 mag. We find that the PDMF of Wd2 has a slope of {{Gamma }}=-1.46+/- 0.06, which translates to a total stellar cluster mass of (3.6+/- 0.3)\cdot {10}4 {M}&sun; . The spatial analysis of the PDMF reveals that the cluster population is mass-segregated and most likely primordial. In addition, we report the detection of a stellar population of spatially uniformly distributed low-mass (< 0.15 {M}&sun; ) stars, extending into the gas ridges of the surrounding gas and dust cloud, as well as a confined region of reddened stars, likely caused by a foreground CO cloud. We find hints that a cloud-cloud collision might be the origin of the formation of Wd2.},

@article{Ginsburg:2016nr,
	Abstract = {Context. The Galactic center is the closest region where we can study star formation under extreme physical conditions like those in high-redshift galaxies.  Aims: We measure the temperature of the dense gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ) and examine what drives it.  Methods: We mapped the inner 300 pc of the CMZ in the temperature-sensitive J = 3-2 para-formaldehyde (p - H2CO) transitions. We used the 32,1-22,0/ 30,3-20,2 line ratio to determine the gas temperature in n ~ 104-105 cm-3 gas. We have produced temperature maps and cubes with 30'' and 1 km s-1 resolution and published all data in FITS form.  Results: Dense gas temperatures in the Galactic center range from ~60 K to >100 K in selected regions. The highest gas temperatures TG> 100 K are observed around the Sgr B2 cores, in the extended Sgr B2 cloud, the 20 km s-1 and 50 km s-1 clouds, and in "The Brick" (G0.253+0.016). We infer an upper limit on the cosmic ray ionization rate zetaCR< 10-14s-1.  Conclusions: The dense molecular gas temperature of the region around our Galactic center is similar to values found in the central regions of other galaxies, in particular starburst systems. The gas temperature is uniformly higher than the dust temperature, confirming that dust is a coolant in the dense gas. Turbulent heating can readily explain the observed temperatures given the observed line widths. Cosmic rays cannot explain the observed variation in gas temperatures, so CMZ dense gas temperatures are not dominated by cosmic ray heating. The gas temperatures previously observed to be high in the inner ~75 pc are confirmed to be high in the entire CMZ.

	Abstract = {We investigate the time-evolution of the mass distribution of pre-stellar cores (PSCs) and their transition to the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in the central parts of a molecular cloud (MC) under the assumption that the coalescence of cores is important. Our aim is to explain the observed shallow IMF in dense stellar clusters such as the Arches cluster. The initial distributions of PSCs at various distances from the MC centre are those of gravitationally unstable cores resulting from the gravo-turbulent fragmentation of the MC. As time evolves, there is a competition between the rates of coalescence and collapse of the PSCs. Whenever the local rate of collapse is larger than the rate of coalescence in a given mass bin, cores are collapsed into stars. With appropriate parameters, we find that the coalescence-collapse model reproduces very well all the observed characteristics of the Arches stellar cluster IMF: namely, the slopes at high- and low-mass ends and the peculiar bump observed at ~ 5-6Msolar. Our results suggest that today's IMF of the Arches cluster is very similar to the primordial one and is little affected by the mass segregation due to dynamical effects.},

	Abstract = {We present new near-infrared photometric measurements of the core of the young massive cluster NGC 3603 obtained with extreme adaptive optics. The data were obtained with the SPHERE instrument mounted on ESO's Very Large Telescope, and cover three fields in the core of this cluster. We applied a correction for the effect of extinction to our data obtained in the J and K broadband filters and estimated the mass of detected sources inside the field of view of SPHERE/IRDIS, which is 13.5''×13.5''. We derived the mass function (MF) slope for each spectral band and field. The MF slope in the core is unusual compared to previous results based on HST and VLT observations. The average slope in the core is estimated as -1.06 $\pm$ 0.26 for the main sequence stars with 3.5 M&sun; < M < 120M&sun;. Thanks to the SPHERE extreme adaptive optics, 814 low-mass stars were detected to estimate the MF slope for the pre-main sequence stars with 0.6 M&sun; < M < 3.5M&sun;, Gamma = -0.54 $\pm$ 0.11 in the K-band images in two fields in the core of the cluster. For the first time, we derive the MF of the very core of the NGC 3603 young cluster for masses in the range 0.6-120 M&sun;. Previous studies were either limited by crowding, lack of dynamic range, or a combination of both.

	Abstract = {Accounting for nebular emission when modeling galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is important, as both line and continuum emissions can contribute significantly to the total observed flux. In this work, we present a new nebular emission model integrated within the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis code that computes the line and continuum emission for complex stellar populations using the photoionization code Cloudy. The self-consistent coupling of the nebular emission to the matched ionizing spectrum produces emission line intensities that correctly scale with the stellar population as a function of age and metallicity. This more complete model of galaxy SEDs will improve estimates of global gas properties derived with diagnostic diagrams, star formation rates based on Halpha, and physical properties derived from broadband photometry. Our models agree well with results from other photoionization models and are able to reproduce observed emission from H II regions and star-forming galaxies. Our models show improved agreement with the observed H II regions in the Ne III/O II plane and show satisfactory agreement with He II emission from z = 2 galaxies, when including rotating stellar models. Models including post-asymptotic giant branch stars are able to reproduce line ratios consistent with low-ionization emission regions. The models are integrated into current versions of FSPS and include self-consistent nebular emission predictions for MIST and Padova+Geneva evolutionary tracks.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the integrated properties of massive (> 10 {M}&sun; ) rotating single-star stellar populations for a variety of initial rotation rates (v/{v}{crit}=0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6). We couple the new MESA Isochrone and Stellar Tracks (MIST) models to the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) package, extending the stellar population synthesis models to include the contributions from very massive stars (> 100 {M}&sun; ), which can be significant in the first ˜4 Myr after a starburst. These models predict ionizing luminosities that are consistent with recent observations of young nuclear star clusters. We also construct composite stellar populations assuming a distribution of initial rotation rates. Even in low-metallicity environments where rotation has a significant effect on the evolution of massive stars, we find that stellar population models require a significant contribution from fast-rotating (v/{v}{crit}> 0.4) stars in order to sustain the production of ionizing photons beyond a few Myr following a starburst. These results have potentially important implications for cosmic reionization by massive stars and the interpretation of nebular emission lines in high-redshift star-forming galaxies.},

In recent years, many very interesting observations have appeared concerning the positions of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD), the number ratios of WR stars, the nature of Type Ibc supernova (SN) progenitors, long and soft gamma ray bursts (LGRB), and the frequency of these various types of explosive events. These observations represent key constraints on massive star evolution.  Aims: We study, in the framework of the single-star evolutionary scenario, how rotation modifies the evolution of a given initial mass star towards the WR phase and how it impacts the rates of Type Ibc SNe. We also discuss the initial conditions required to obtain collapsars and LGRB.  Methods: We used a recent grid of stellar models computed with and without rotation to make predictions concerning the WR populations and the frequency of different types of core-collapse SNe. Current rotating models were checked to provide good fits to the following features: solar luminosity and radius at the solar age, main-sequence width, red-giant and red-supergiant (RSG) positions in the HRD, surface abundances, and rotational velocities.  Results: Rotating stellar models predict that about half of the observed WR stars and at least half of the Type Ibc SNe may be produced through the single-star evolution channel. Rotation increases the duration of the WNL and WNC phases, while reducing those of the WNE and WC phases, as was already shown in previous works. Rotation increases the frequency of Type Ic SNe. The upper mass limit for Type II-P SNe is ~19.0 M&sun; for the non rotating models and ~16.8 M&sun; for the rotating ones. Both values agree with observations. Moreover, present rotating models provide a very good fit to the progenitor of SN 2008ax. We discuss future directions of research for further improving the agreement between the models and the observations. We conclude that the mass-loss rates in the WNL and RSG phases are probably underestimated at present. We show that up to an initial mass of 40 M&sun;, a surface magnetic field inferior to about 200 G may be sufficient to produce some braking. Much lower values are needed at the red supergiant stage. We suggest that the presence/absence of any magnetic braking effect may play a key role in questions regarding rotation rates of young pulsars and the evolution leading to LGRBs.},

	Abstract = {Several independent lines of evidence suggest that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in early-type galaxies becomes increasingly "bottom-heavy" with increasing galaxy mass and/or velocity dispersion, sigma. Here we consider evidence for IMF variation in a sample of relatively compact early-type galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These galaxies are of sufficiently high stellar density that a dark halo likely makes a minor contribution to the total dynamical mass, M dyn, within one effective radius. We fit our detailed stellar population synthesis models to the stacked absorption line spectra of these galaxies in bins of sigma and find evidence from IMF-sensitive spectral features for a bottom-heavy IMF at high sigma. We also apply simple "mass-follows-light" dynamical models to the same data and find that M dyn is significantly higher than what would be expected if these galaxies were stellar dominated and had a universal Milky Way IMF. Adopting M dyn ≈ M * therefore implies that the IMF is "heavier" at high sigma. Most importantly, the quantitative amount of inferred IMF variation is very similar between the two techniques, agreeing to within <~ 0.1 dex in mass. The agreement between two independent techniques, when applied to the same data, provides compelling evidence for systematic variation in the IMF as a function of early-type galaxy velocity dispersion. Any alternative explanations must reproduce both the results from dynamical and stellar population-based techniques.},

	Abstract = {Fifty years after Ed Salpeter's seminal paper, tremendous progress both on the observational and theoretical sides allow a fairly accurate determination of the Galactic IMF not only down to the hydrogen-burning limit but into the brown dwarf domain. The present review includes the most recent observations of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs to determine this IMF and the related Galactic mass budget. The IMF definitely exhibits a similar behaviour in various environments, disk, young and globular clusters, spheroid. Small scale dissipation of large scale compressible MHD turbulence seems to be the underlying triggering mechanism for star formation. Modern simulations of compressible MHD turbulence yield an IMF consistent with the one derived from observations.},

	Abstract = {We use the results of a new multiepoch, multiwavelength, near-infrared census of the Trapezium cluster in Orion to construct and analyze the structure of its infrared (K-band) luminosity function. Specifically, we employ an improved set of model luminosity functions to derive this cluster's underlying initial mass function (IMF) across the entire range of mass from OB stars to substellar objects down to near the deuterium-burning limit. We derive an IMF for the Trapezium cluster that rises with decreasing mass, having a Salpeter-like IMF slope until near ~0.6 Msolar where the IMF flattens and forms a broad peak extending to the hydrogen-burning limit, below which the IMF declines into the substellar regime. Independent of the details, we find that substellar objects account for no more than ~22% of the total number of likely cluster members. Further, the substellar Trapezium IMF breaks from a steady power-law decline and forms a significant secondary peak at the lowest masses (10-20 times the mass of Jupiter). This secondary peak may contain as many as ~30% of the substellar objects in the cluster. Below this substellar IMF peak, our K-band luminosity function (KLF) modeling requires a subsequent sharp decline toward the planetary mass regime. Lastly, we investigate the robustness of pre-main-sequence luminosity evolution as predicted by current evolutionary models, and we discuss possible origins for the IMF of brown dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {The star-formation history and IMF of the field population of the 30 Doradus super-association is determined using Wide Field Imager photometry. The cluster NGC 2070 and the OB association LH104 are also studied and used for comparison. The star-formation history of the 30 Doradus super-association appears to be characterized by a large increase in star-formation activity 10 Myr to 20 Myr ago. This seems to be the case across the whole eastern half of the LMC as demonstrated by the ages of stellar populations as far away as 30 Doradus and Shapley's Constellation III. Star-formation appears to be occurring at a constant rate in the field and in loose associations, and in bursts in the clusters. The field IMF is found to have almost the exact Salpeter slope in the range 7 ~M_&sun; <= M <= 40 ~M_&sun;, at odds with previous claims. We find that, for objects with more complex star-formation histories, Be stars and selective incompleteness strongly affect the determination of the IMF for M > 40~ M_&sun;, naturally explaining the observed deviation of the high mass IMF slope from the Salpeter value. The present work supports the idea of a universal IMF.  Based on observations obtained with the MPG/ESO 2.2-m telescope at La Silla Observatory.

	Abstract = {The conversion of gas into stars is a fundamental process in astrophysics and cosmology. Stars are known to form from the gravitational collapse of dense clumps in interstellar molecular clouds, and it has been proposed that the resulting star formation rate is proportional to either the amount of mass above a threshold gas surface density, or the gas volume density. These star formation prescriptions appear to hold in nearby molecular clouds in our Milky Way Galaxy's disc as well as in distant galaxies where the star formation rates are often much larger. The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), contains the largest concentration of dense, high-surface density molecular gas in the Milky Way, providing an environment where the validity of star formation prescriptions can be tested. Here, we show that by several measures, the current star formation rate in the CMZ is an order-of-magnitude lower than the rates predicted by the currently accepted prescriptions. In particular, the region 1$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 3$\,^{\circ}$.5, |b| < 0$\,^{\circ}$.5 contains ˜107 M&sun; of dense (> several 103 cm-3) molecular gas - enough to form 1000 Orion-like clusters - but the present-day star formation rate within this gas is only equivalent to that in Orion. In addition to density, another property of molecular clouds must be included in the star formation prescription to predict the star formation rate in a given mass of molecular gas. We discuss which physical mechanisms might be responsible for suppressing star formation in the CMZ.},

	Abstract = {We have used the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim{\'e}trique (IRAM) Plateau de Bure Interferometer and the Expanded Very Large Array to obtain a high-resolution map of the CO(6-5) and CO(1-0) emission in the lensed, star-forming galaxy SMM J2135-0102 at z = 2.32. The kinematics of the gas are well described by a model of a rotationally supported disk with an inclination-corrected rotation speed, v rot = 320 $\pm$ 25 km s-1, a ratio of rotational-to-dispersion support of v/sigma = 3.5 $\pm$ 0.2, and a dynamical mass of (6.0 $\pm$ 0.5) × 1010 M &sun; within a radius of 2.5 kpc. The disk has a Toomre parameter, Q = 0.50 $\pm$ 0.15, suggesting that the gas will rapidly fragment into massive clumps on scales of L J ~ 400 pc. We identify star-forming regions on these scales and show that they are ~10 × denser than those in quiescent environments in local galaxies, and significantly offset from the local molecular cloud scaling relations (Larson's relations). The large offset compared to local molecular cloud line-width-size scaling relations implies that supersonic turbulence should remain dominant on scales ~100× smaller than in the kinematically quiescent interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way, while the molecular gas in SMM J2135 is expected to be ~50× denser than that in the Milky Way on all scales. This is most likely due to the high external hydrostatic pressure we measure for the ISM, P tot/k B ~ (2 $\pm$ 1) × 107 K cm-3. In such highly turbulent ISM, the subsonic regions of gravitational collapse (and star formation) will be characterized by much higher critical densities, n crit > = 108 cm-3, a factor gsim1000× more than the quiescent ISM of the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {We present optical spectroscopy obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph of five young massive star clusters in the starburst galaxy M82. A detailed analysis is performed for one cluster `M82-A1' and its immediate environment in the starburst core. From Hubble Space Telescope archive images, we find that it is elliptical with an effective radius of 3.0 +/- 0.5pc and is surrounded by a compact (r = 4.5 +/- 0.5pc) HII region. We determine the age and reddening of M82-A1 using synthetic spectra from population synthesis models by fitting both the continuum energy distribution and the depth of the Balmer jump. We find an age of 6.4 +/- 0.5Myr and a photometric mass estimate of M = 7-13 × 105 Msolar. We associate its formation with the most recent starburst event 4-6Myr ago. We find that the oxygen abundance of the HII region surrounding M82-A1 is solar or slightly higher. The HII region has a high pressure P/k = 1-2 × 107 cm-3K. The diffuse gas in region A has a slightly lower pressure, which together with the broad Halpha emission-line width, suggests that both the thermal and turbulent pressures in the M82 starburst core are unusually high. We discuss how this environment has affected the evolution of the cluster wind for M82-A1. We find that the high pressure may have caused the pressure-driven bubble to stall. We also obtain spectroscopic ages for clusters B1-2 and B2-1 in the `fossil' starburst region and for the intermediate age clusters F and L. These are consistent with earlier studies and demonstrate that star formation activity, sufficiently intense to produce super star clusters, has been going on in M82 during the past Gyr, perhaps in discrete and localized episodes.},

	Abstract = {We present a review of spatially resolved giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in nearby galaxies, aiming at providing a template of GMC properties, which may be extrapolated to distant galaxies. We focus on the Magellanic system including the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC), M33, and a few dwarfs as observed in the J = 1-0 12CO transition at 2.6-mm wavelength. The X factor, a conversion factor of the 12CO intensity to total molecular column density, and the GMC mass distribution, dN/dM, are similar among these galaxies, suggesting that GMCs share similar properties in the Local Group. The GMCs are classified into three types according to their level of star-formation activity and the types are interpreted in terms of evolution in 20-30 Myr rather than as three different generic types. A three-dimensional comparison including the velocity axis has revealed that GMCs in the LMC are associated with Hi envelopes. The Hi envelopes are probably gravitationally bound and may be infalling to increase the GMC mass via Hi-H2 conversion. Recent submillimeter observations are revealing dense and warm clumps in GMCs, suggesting that the interior of a GMC also follows contraction leading to star formation on a similar timescale. Finally, we present an attempt to place these GMC properties among more distant galaxies and discuss future observational prospects.},

@article{Kruijssen:2013lh,
	Abstract = {Detailed observations of the nearest star-forming regions in the Milky Way (MW) provide the ultimate benchmark for studying star formation. The extent to which the results of these Galaxy-based studies can be extrapolated to extragalactic systems depends on the overlap of the environmental conditions probed. In this paper, we compare the properties of clouds and star-forming regions in the MW with those in nearby galaxies and in the high-redshift Universe. We find that in terms of their baryonic composition, kinematics and densities, the clouds in the solar neighbourhood are similar to those in nearby galaxies. The clouds and regions in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the inner 250 pc) of the MW are indistinguishable from high-redshift clouds and galaxies. The presently low star formation rate in the CMZ therefore implies that either (1) its gas represents the initial conditions for high-redshift starbursts or (2) some yet unidentified process consistently suppresses star formation over ≳ 108 yr time-scales. We conclude that the MW contains large reservoirs of gas with properties directly comparable to most of the known range of star formation environments and is therefore an excellent template for studying star formation across cosmological time-scales.},

	Abstract = {As part of a larger program aimed at investigating the universality of the initial mass function (IMF) at low masses in a number of young clusters in the LMC and SMC, we present a new study of the low end of the stellar IMF of NGC 330, the richest young star cluster in the SMC, from deep broadband V and I images obtained with HST/WFPC2. We detect stars down to a limiting magnitude of m555=24.9, which corresponds to stellar masses of ~0.8Msolar at the distance of the SMC. A comparison of the cluster color-magnitude diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks indicates an age of ~30 Myr for NGC 330, in agreement with previous published results. We derive the cluster luminosity function, which we correct for background contamination using an adjacent SMC field, and construct the mass function in the 1-7Msolar mass range. Given the young cluster age, the MF can well approximate the IMF. We find that the IMF in the central cluster regions (within 30") is well reproduced by a power law with a slope consistent with Salpeter's. In addition, the richness of the cluster allows us to investigate the IMF as a function of radial distance from the center. We find that the IMF becomes steeper at increasing distances from the cluster center (between 30" and 90"), with the number of massive stars (>5Msolar) decreasing from the core to the outskirts of the cluster 5 times more rapidly than the less-massive objects (~=1Msolar). We believe the observed mass segregation to be of a primordial nature rather than dynamical since the age of NGC 330 is 10 times shorter than the expected relaxation time of the cluster.

	Abstract = {We have studied the effects of various initial mass functions (IMFs) on the chemical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). In particular, we tested the effects of the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) on various predicted abundance patterns. The IGIMF depends on the star formation rate and metallicity and predicts less massive stars in a regime of low star formation, as it is the case in dwarf spheroidals. We adopted a detailed chemical evolution model following the evolution of alpha-elements, Fe and Eu, and assuming the currently best set of stellar yields. We also explored different yield prescriptions for the Eu, including production from neutron star mergers. Although the uncertainties still present in the stellar yields and data prevent us from drawing firm conclusions, our results suggest that the IGIMF applied to Sgr predicts lower [alpha/Fe] ratios than classical IMFs and lower [hydrostatic/explosive] alpha-element ratios, in qualitative agreement with observations. In our model, the observed high [Eu/O] ratios in Sgr is due to reduced O production, resulting from the IGIMF mass cut-off of the massive oxygen-producing stars, as well as to the Eu yield produced in neutron star mergers, a more promising site than core-collapse supernovae, although many uncertainties are still present in the Eu nucleosynthesis. We find that a model, similar to our previous calculations, based on the late addition of iron from the Type Ia supernova time-delay (necessary to reproduce the shape of [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relations) but also including the reduction of massive stars due to the IGIMF, better reproduces the observed abundance ratios in Sgr than models without the IGIMF.},

	Abstract = {Recent evidence based independently on spectral line strengths and dynamical modelling point towards a non-universal stellar initial mass function (IMF), probably implying an excess of low-mass stars in elliptical galaxies with a high velocity dispersion. Here, we show that a time-independent bottom-heavy IMF is compatible neither with the observed metal-rich populations found in giant ellipticals nor with the number of stellar remnants observed within these systems. We suggest a two-stage formation scenario involving a time-dependent IMF to reconcile these observational constraints. In this model, an early strong starbursting stage with a top-heavy IMF is followed by a more prolonged stage with a bottom-heavy IMF. Such model is physically motivated by the fact that a sustained high star formation will bring the interstellar medium to a state of pressure, temperature and turbulence that can drastically alter the fragmentation of the gaseous component into small clumps, promoting the formation of low-mass stars. This toy model is in good agreement with the different observational constrains on massive elliptical galaxies, such as age, metallicity, alpha-enhancement, mass-to-light ratio or the mass fraction of the stellar component in low-mass stars.},

	Abstract = {Observational studies are showing that the galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function (IMF) is top-heavy in galaxies with high star formation rates (SFRs). Calculating the integrated galactic stellar initial mass function (IGIMF) as a function of the SFR of a galaxy, it follows that galaxies which have or which formed with SFRs >10 M&sun; yr-1 would have a top-heavy IGIMF in excellent consistency with the observations. Consequently and in agreement with observations, elliptical galaxies would have higher mass-to-light ratios as a result of the overabundance of stellar remnants compared to a stellar population that formed with an invariant canonical stellar IMF. For the Milky Way, the IGIMF yields very good agreement with the disc- and the bulge IMF determinations. Our conclusions are that purely stochastic descriptions of star formation on the scales of a parsec and above are falsified. Instead, star formation follows the laws, stated here as axioms, which define the IGIMF theory. We also find evidence that the power-law index beta of the embedded cluster mass function decreases with increasing SFR. We propose further tests of the IGIMF theory through counting massive stars in dwarf galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present wide-field deep {UBVI} photometry for the previously unstudied open cluster NGC 4852 down to a limiting magnitude I˜24, obtained from observations taken with the Wide Field Imager camera on-board the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope at La Silla (ESO, Chile). These data are used to obtain the first estimate of the cluster basic parameters, to study the cluster spatial extension by means of star counts, and to derive the Luminosity (LF) and Mass Function (MF). The cluster radius turns out to be 5.0$\pm$1.0 arcmin. The cluster emerges clearly from the field down to V=20 mag. At fainter magnitudes, it is completely confused with the general Galactic disk field. The stars inside this region define a young open cluster (200 million years old) 1.1 kpc far from the Sun (m-M = 11.60, E(B-V) = 0.45). The Present Day Mass Functions (PDMF) from the V photometry is one of the most extended in mass obtained to date, and can be represented as a power-law with a slope alpha = 2.3$\pm$0.3 and (the Salpeter MF in this notation has a slope alpha = 2.35), in the mass range 3.2 <= {m}/{m&sun;} <= 0.6. Below this mass, the MF cannot be considered as representative of the cluster MF, as the cluster merges with the field and therefore the MF is the result of the combined effect of strong irregularities in the stellar background and interaction of the cluster with the dense Galactic field. The cluster total mass at the limiting magnitude results to be 2570$\pm$210  M&sun;.},

@article{Papadopoulos:2011qu,
	Abstract = {We examine in detail the recent proposal that extreme cosmic ray dominated regions (CRDRs) characterize the interstellar medium of galaxies during events of high-density star formation, fundamentally altering its initial conditions (Papadopoulos 2010). Solving the coupled chemical and thermal state equations for dense UV-shielded gas reveals that the large CR energy densities in such systems [UCR ˜ few × (103-104) UCR, Gal] will indeed raise the minimum temperature of this phase (where the initial conditions of star formation are set) from ˜10 K (as in the Milky Way) to ˜50-100 K. Moreover in such extreme CRDRs the gas temperature remains fully decoupled from that of the dust, with Tkin≫Tdust, even at high densities [n(H2) ˜ 105-106 cm-3], quite unlike CRDRs in the Milky Way where Tk˜Tdust when n(H2) ≳ 105 cm-3. These dramatically different star formation initial conditions will (i) boost the Jeans mass of UV-shielded gas regions by factors of ˜10-100 with respect to those in quiescent or less extreme star-forming systems and (ii) 'erase' the so-called inflection point of the effective equation of state of molecular gas. Both these effects occur across the entire density range of typical molecular clouds, and may represent a new paradigm for all high-density star formation in the Universe, with CRs as the key driving mechanism, operating efficiently even in the high dust extinction environments of compact extreme starbursts. The characteristic mass of young stars will be boosted as a result, naturally yielding a top-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) and a bimodal star formation mode (with the occurrence of extreme CRDRs setting the branching point). Such CRDRs will be present in Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) and merger-driven gas-rich starbursts across the Universe where large amounts of molecular gas rapidly dissipate towards compact disc configurations where they fuel intense starbursts. In hierarchical galaxy formation models, CR-controlled star formation initial conditions lend a physical basis for the currently postulated bimodal IMF in merger/starburst versus quiescent/disc star-forming environments, while naturally making the integrated galactic IMFs a function of the star formation history of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {In order to estimate the masses of the compact, young star clusters in the merging galaxy pair, NGC 4038/4039 (``the Antennae''), we have obtained medium and high resolution spectroscopy using ISAAC on VLT-UT1 and UVES on VLT-UT2 of five such clusters. The velocity dispersions were estimated using the stellar absorption features of CO at 2.29 mu m and metal absorption lines at around 8500 {\AA}, including lines of the Calcium Triplet. The size scales and light profiles were measured from HST images. From these data and assuming Virial equilibrium, we estimated the masses of five clusters. The resulting masses range from 6.5 x 105 to 4.7 x 106 Msun. These masses are large, a factor of a few to more than 10 larger than the typical mass of a globular cluster in the Milky Way. The mass-to-light ratios for these clusters in the V- and K-bands in comparison with stellar synthesis models suggest that to first order the IMF slopes are approximately consistent with Salpeter for a mass range of 0.1 to 100 Msun. However, the clusters show a significant range of possible IMF slopes or lower mass cut-offs and that these variations may correlate with the interstellar environment of the cluster. Comparison with the results of Fokker-Planck simulations of compact clusters with properties similar to the clusters studied here suggest that they are likely to be long-lived and may lose a substantial fraction of their total mass. This mass loss would make the star clusters obtain masses which are comparable to the typical mass of a globular cluster.

	Abstract = {We have determined the dynamical mass of the most luminous stellar cluster known to date, i.e. object W3 in the merger remnant galaxy NGC 7252. The dynamical mass is estimated from the velocity dispersion measured with the high-resolution spectrograph UVES on VLT. Our result is the astonishingly high velocity dispersion of sigma=45 $\pm$ 5 km s-1. Combined with the large cluster size Reff=17.5 $\pm$ 1.8 pc, this translates into a dynamical virial mass for W3 of  (8 $\pm$ 2) × 107 M&sun;. This mass is in excellent agreement with the value (˜7.2× 107 M&sun;) we previously estimated from the cluster luminosity (MV=-16.2) by means of stellar M/L ratios predicted by Simple Stellar Population models (with a Salpeter IMF) and confirms the heavy-weight nature of this object. This results points out that the NGC 7252-type of mergers are able to form stellar systems with masses up to ˜108 M&sun;. We find that W3, when evolved to ˜10 Gyr, lies far from the typical Milky Way globular clusters, but appears to be also separated from omegaCen in the Milky Way and G1 in M 31, the most massive old stellar clusters of the Local Group, because it is too extended for a given mass, and from dwarf elliptical galaxies because it is much more compact for its mass. Instead the aged W3 is amazingly close to the compact objects named ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDGs) found in the Fornax cluster (Hilker et al. \cite{Hilker99}; Drinkwater et al. \cite{Drinkwater00}), and to a miniature version of the compact elliptical M 32. These objects start populating a previously deserted region of the fundamental plane.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, ID: 67.D-0205(A).},

	Abstract = {We present evidence that some of the compact, luminous, young star clusters discovered recently through images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (MST) have masses comparable to those of old Galactic globular clusters. The "super star cluster" in the center of the nearby amorphous galaxy NGC 1705 has been observed with high dispersion at optical wavelengths using the HIRES echelle spectrograph on the Keck 10 m telescope. Numerous weak metal lines arising from the atmospheres of cool supergiants have been detected in the integrated spectrum, permitting a direct measurement of the line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion through cross-correlation with a template star; the result is sigma_*_ = 11.4 +/- 1.5 km s^-1^. Assuming that the system is gravitationally bound and using a cluster size measured from MST images, we apply the virial theorem to obtain the dynamical mass. Its derived mass [(8.2 +/- 2.1) x 10^4^ M_sun_], mass density (2.7 +/- 10^4^ M_sun_ pc^-3^), and predicted mass-to-light ratio after aging by 10-15 Gyr [0.6-1.6 (M/L_V_)_sun_] closely resemble those of the majority of evolved Galactic globular clusters. The central cluster in NGC 1705 appears to be very similar in nature to one of the bright clusters in NGC 1569, which was discussed earlier this year by Ho & Filippenko. We also observed the brightest cluster in the Magellanic irregular galaxy NGC 4214, but no lines suitable for measuring its velocity dispersion were detected, most likely because of the very young age of the cluster. Although these observations need to be extended to a much larger sample of objects before generalizations can be made concerning the nature of similar clusters observed in other galaxies, our preliminary results are tantalizing and strongly suggest that, at least in two cases, we are witnessing globular clusters in their extreme youth.},

	Abstract = {Residual-gas expulsion after cluster formation has recently been shown to leave an imprint in the low-mass present-day stellar mass function (PDMF) which allowed the estimation of birth conditions of some Galactic globular clusters (GCs) such as mass, radius and star formation efficiency. We show that in order to explain their characteristics (masses, radii, metallicity and PDMF) their stellar initial mass function (IMF) must have been top heavy. It is found that the IMF is required to become more top heavy the lower the cluster metallicity and the larger the pre-GC cloud-core density are. The deduced trends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectation. The results are consistent with estimates of the shape of the high-mass end of the IMF in the Arches cluster, Westerlund 1, R136 and NGC 3603, as well as with the IMF independently constrained for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). The latter suggests that GCs and UCDs might have formed along the same channel or that UCDs formed via mergers of GCs. A Fundamental Plane is found which describes the variation of the IMF with density and metallicity of the pre-GC cloud cores. The implications for the evolution of galaxies and chemical enrichment over cosmological times are expected to be major.},

Using model fits to the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra and the weakness of red supergiant CO absorption features (appearing at ~6 Myr) in the NIFS H-band spectra, the ages of A2 and A3 are 4.5 $\pm$ 1.0 Myr. A1 has strong CO bands, consistent with our previously determined age of 6.4 $\pm$ 0.5 Myr. The photometric masses of the three clusters are 4-7 × 105 M &sun;, and their sizes are R eff = 159, 104, 59 mas (~2.8, 1.8, 1.0 pc) for A1, A2, and A3. The STIS spectra yielded radial velocities of 320 $\pm$ 2, 330 $\pm$ 6, and 336 $\pm$ 5 km s-1 for A1, A2, and A3, placing them at the eastern end of the x 2 orbits of M82's bar. Clusters A2 and A3 are in high-density (800-1000 cm-3) environments, and like A1, are surrounded by compact H II regions. We suggest the winds from A2 and A3 have stalled, as in A1, due to the high ISM ambient pressure. We propose that the three clusters were formed in situ on the outer x 2 orbits in regions of dense molecular gas subsequently ionized by the rapidly evolving starburst. The similar radial velocities of the three clusters and their small projected separation of ~25 pc suggest that they may merge in the near future unless this is prevented by velocity shearing.

	Abstract = {We show that we can obtain a good fit to the present-day stellar mass functions (MFs) of a large sample of young and old Galactic clusters in the range 0.1-10 M sun with a tapered power-law distribution function with an exponential truncation of the form dN/dm ∝ m^alpha [1 - e^ {-(m/m_c)^beta} ]. The average value of the power-law index alpha is ~-2, that of beta is ~2.5, whereas the characteristic mass mc is in the range 0.1-0.8 M sun and does not seem to vary in any systematic way with the present cluster parameters such as metal abundance, total cluster mass, or central concentration. However, mc shows a remarkable correlation with the dynamical age of the cluster, namely, mc /M sun ~= 0.15 + 0.5 × tau3/4 dyn, where taudyn is the dynamical age taken as the ratio of cluster age and dissolution time. The small scatter seen around this correlation is consistent with the uncertainties in the estimated value of taudyn. We attribute the observed trend to the onset of mass segregation via two-body relaxation in a tidal environment, causing the preferential loss of low-mass stars from the cluster and hence a drift of the characteristic mass mc toward higher values. If dynamical evolution is indeed at the origin of the observed trend, it would seem plausible that high-concentration globular clusters, now with median mc ~= 0.33 M sun, were born with a stellar MF very similar to that measured today in the youngest Galactic clusters and with a value of mc ~= 0.15 M sun. This hypothesis is consistent with the absence of a turnover in the MF of the Galactic bulge down to the observational limit at ~0.2 M sun and, if correct, it would carry the implication that the characteristic mass is not set by the thermal Jeans mass of the cloud.},

We have selected ˜700 cluster member candidates in ˜56 square degrees in alpha Per by combining photometry in five near-infrared passbands and proper motions derived from the multiple epochs provided by the UKIDSS Galactic Clusters Survey (GCS) Data Release 9 (DR9). We also provide revised membership for all previously published alpha Per low-mass stars and brown dwarfs recovered in GCS based on the new photometry and astrometry provided by DR9. We find no evidence of K-band variability in members of alpha Per with dispersion less than 0.06-0.09 mag. We employed two independent but complementary methods to derive the cluster luminosity and mass functions: a probabilistic analysis and a more standard approach consisting of stricter astrometric and photometric cuts. We find that the resulting luminosity and mass functions obtained from both methods are consistent. We find that the shape of the alpha Per mass function is similar to that of the Pleiades although the characteristic mass may be higher after including higher mass data from earlier studies (the dispersion is comparable). We conclude that the mass functions of alpha Per, the Pleiades and Praesepe are best reproduced by a log-normal representation similar to the system field mass function although with some variation in the characteristic mass and dispersion values.

	Abstract = {We present the first high spatial resolution X-ray study of NGC 2244, the 2 Myr old stellar cluster in the Rosette Nebula, using Chandra. Over 900 X-ray sources are detected; 77% have optical or FLAMINGOS NIR stellar counterparts and are mostly previously uncataloged young cluster members. The X-ray-selected population is estimated to be nearly complete between 0.5 and 3 M&sun;. A number of further results emerge from our analysis: (1) The X-ray LF and the associated K-band LF indicate a normal Salpeter IMF for NGC 2244. This is inconsistent with the top-heavy IMF reported from earlier optical studies that lacked a good census of <4 M&sun; stars. By comparing the NGC 2244 and Orion Nebula Cluster XLFs, we estimate a total population of ~2000 stars in NGC 2244. (2) The spatial distribution of X-ray stars is strongly concentrated around the central O5 star, HD 46150. The other early O star, HD 46223, has few companions. The cluster's stellar radial density profile shows two distinctive structures: a power-law cusp around HD 46150 that extends to ~0.7 pc, surrounded by an isothermal sphere extending out to 4 pc with core radius 1.2 pc. This double structure, combined with the absence of mass segregation, indicates that this 2 Myr old cluster is not in dynamical equilibrium. (3) The fraction of X-ray-selected cluster members with K-band excesses caused by inner protoplanetary disks is 6%, slightly lower than the 10% disk fraction estimated from the FLAMINGOS study based on the NIR-selected sample. (4) X-ray luminosities for 24 stars earlier than B4 confirm the long-standing log (LX/Lbol) ~ - 7 relation. The Rosette OB X-ray spectra are soft and consistent with the standard model of small-scale shocks in the inner wind of a single massive star.},

@article{Massey:1998lz,
	Abstract = {The R136 cluster in 30 Doradus is the prototype ``super star cluster,'' and the only example sufficiently close that its massive star content can be studied directly. We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain spectra of 65 of the bluest, most luminous stars in R136 and find that the majority of these stars are of type O3, the hottest, most luminous, and most massive stars known. The total number of O3 stars in this one cluster exceeds the total number known elsewhere in the Milky Way or Magellanic Clouds. The highest luminosity stars found are O3 If*, O4 If+, O3 If/WN6-A, and H-rich WN stars, with masses in excess of 120 \Mscrsolar, the highest masses for which appropriate evolutionary tracks are currently available. In accord with de Koter, Heap, & Hubeny, we conclude that these WN stars must be core H-burning stars whose spectra are WR-like because of high luminosity, and we find that their individual luminosities are a factor of 10 higher than is normal for WN stars of similar type but are like those found in the Galactic cluster NGC 3603, which they also resemble spectroscopically. Our spectroscopy does include stars as late as B0 V and samples most stars in the core of the R136 cluster with masses >50 M&sun;. The spectroscopy has been combined with HST photometry to study the star formation history and initial mass function of the R136 cluster. The young age (<1-2 Myr) for the highest mass stars, combined with what was previously known for the intermediate-mass populations, suggests that the lower mass stars began forming 4-5 Myr ago and continued forming until the high mass stars formed, consistent with the paradigm in which the formation of massive stars shuts down further star formation in the molecular cloud. Despite the unique preponderance of the highest mass and luminosity stars ever seen, the initial mass function (IMF) is found to be completely normal, with a slope Gamma = -1.3 to -1.4. The number of high-mass stars is in good accord with that predicted by the IMF of the intermediate-mass stars, suggesting that a Salpeter-like IMF holds over the mass range 2.8-120 \Mscrsolar within the R136 cluster. The fact that the IMF slope in R136 is indistinguishable from those of Galactic and Magellanic Cloud OB associations suggests that star formation produces the same distribution of masses over a range of ~200 times in stellar density, from that of sparse OB associations to that typical of globular clusters. The large number of O3 stars in R136 is then simply a consequence of its youth (<1-2 Myr) and its richness, suggesting that the upper mass ``cutoff'' to the IMF seen in OB associations may simply be the result of their sparcity.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We present deep Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS 2 F160W band observations of the central 56'' × 57'' (14 pc × 14.25 pc) region around R136 in the starburst cluster 30 Dor (NGC 2070) located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our aim is to derive the stellar initial mass function (IMF) down to ~1 M sun in order to test whether the IMF in a massive metal-poor cluster is similar to that observed in nearby young clusters and the field in our Galaxy. We estimate the mean age of the cluster to be 3 Myr by combining our F160W photometry with previously obtained HST WFPC2 optical F555W and F814W band photometry and comparing the stellar locus in the color-magnitude diagram with main sequence and pre-main sequence isochrones. The color-magnitude diagrams show the presence of differential extinction and possibly an age spread of a few megayear. We convert the magnitudes into masses adopting both a single mean age of 3 Myr isochrone and a constant star formation history from 2 to 4 Myr. We derive the IMF after correcting for incompleteness due to crowding. The faintest stars detected have a mass of 0.5 M sun and the data are more than 50% complete outside a radius of 5 pc down to a mass limit of 1.1 M sun for 3 Myr old objects. We find an IMF of {dN}/{d log M }∝ M^{-1.20$\pm$ 0.2} over the mass range 1.1-20 M sun only slightly shallower than a Salpeter IMF. In particular, we find no strong evidence for a flattening of the IMF down to 1.1 M sun at a distance of 5 pc from the center, in contrast to a flattening at 2 M sun at a radius of 2 pc, reported in a previous optical HST study. We examine several possible reasons for the different results including the possible presence of mass segregation and the effects of differential extinction, particularly for the pre-main sequence sources. If the IMF determined here applies to the whole cluster, the cluster would be massive enough to remain bound and evolve into a relatively low-mass globular cluster.},

	Abstract = {We present a UBVI and Halpha photometric study of the young open cluster NGC 1893 in the H II region W8 (IC 410 or Sh 2-236). A total of 65 early-type members are selected from photometric diagrams. A mean reddening of the stars is <E(B - V)> = 0.563 $\pm$ 0.083 mag. The published photometric data in the near- and mid-infrared passbands are used to test the reddening law towards the cluster, and we confirm that the reddening law is normal (RV = 3.1). Zero-age main-sequence fitting gives a distance modulus of V0 - MV = 12.7 $\pm$ 0.2 mag, equivalent to 3.5 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc. From Halpha photometry, 125 Halpha emission stars and candidates are identified as pre-main-sequence (PMS). The lists of young stellar objects and X-ray sources published by previous studies allow us to select a large number of PMS members down to 1 M&sun;. Isochrone fitting in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram gives a turn-off age of 1.5 Myr and the median age of 1.9 Myr from the PMS members with a spread of ˜5 Myr. We derive the initial mass function (IMF) for stars with mass larger than 1 M&sun;. The slope of the IMF (Gamma = -1.3 $\pm$ 0.1) is well consistent with the Salpeter/Kroupa IMF. A total mass of the cluster appears to be in excess of 1300 M&sun;. Finally, we estimate the mass accretion rate of 82 PMS members in the mass range of 0.6-5 M&sun;.},

	Abstract = {We have performed new wide-field photometry of the young open cluster NGC 6231 to study the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) and mass segregation. We also investigated the reddening law toward NGC 6231 from optical to mid-infrared color excess ratios, and found that the total-to-selective extinction ratio is RV = 3.2, which is very close to the normal value. But many early-type stars in the cluster center show large color excess ratios. We derived the surface density profiles of four member groups, and found that they reach the surface density of field stars at about 10', regardless of stellar mass. The IMF of NGC 6231 is derived for the mass range 0.8-45 M &sun;. The slope of the IMF of NGC 6231 (Gamma = -1.1 $\pm$ 0.1) is slightly shallower than the canonical value, but the difference is marginal. In addition, the mass function varies systematically, and is a strong function of radius---it is very shallow at the center, and very steep at the outer ring suggesting the cluster is mass segregated. We confirm the mass segregation for the massive stars (m >~ 8 M &sun;) by a minimum spanning tree analysis. Using a Monte Carlo method, we estimate the total mass of NGC 6231 to be about 2.6 ($\pm$ 0.6) × 103 M &sun;. We constrain the age of NGC 6231 by comparison with evolutionary isochrones. The age of the low-mass stars ranges from 1 to 7 Myr with a slight peak at 3 Myr. However, the age of the high-mass stars depends on the adopted models and is 3.5 $\pm$ 0.5 Myr from the non-rotating or moderately rotating models of Brott et al. as well as the non-rotating models of Ekstr{\"o}m et al. But the age is 4.0-7.0 Myr if the rotating models of Ekstr{\"o}m et al. are adopted. This latter age is in excellent agreement with the timescale of ejection of the high-mass runaway star HD 153919 from NGC 6231, albeit the younger age cannot be entirely excluded.},

	Abstract = {We present deep wide-field optical CCD photometry and mid-infrared Spitzer/IRAC and MIPS 24 mum data for about 100,000 stars in the young open cluster IC 1805. The members of IC 1805 were selected from their location in the various color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, and the presence of Halpha emission, mid-infrared excess emission, and X-ray emission. The reddening law toward IC 1805 is nearly normal (R  V  = 3.05 $\pm$ 0.06). However, the distance modulus of the cluster is estimated to be 11.9 $\pm$ 0.2 mag (d=2.4+/- 0.2 kpc) from the reddening-free color-magnitude diagrams, which is larger than the distance to the nearby massive star-forming region W3(OH) measured from the radio VLBA astrometry. We also determined the age of IC 1805 ({tau }{MSTO}=3.5 Myr). In addition, we critically compared the age and mass scale from two pre-main-sequence evolution models. The initial mass function with a Salpeter-type slope of Gamma = -1.3 $\pm$ 0.2 was obtained and the total mass of IC 1805 was estimated to be about 2700 $\pm$ 200 {M}&sun; . Finally, we found our distance determination to be statistically consistent with the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution Data Release 1, within the errors. The proper motion of the B-type stars shows an elongated distribution along the Galactic plane, which could be explained by some of the B-type stars being formed in small clouds dispersed by previous episodes of star formation or supernova explosions.  The optical imaging data in this article were gathered with two facilities: the AZT-22 1.5 m telescope at Maidanak Astronomical Observatory in Uzbekistan and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

	Abstract = {Deep F555W and F814W Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS) images are the basis for a study of the present-day mass function (PDMF) of NGC 346, the largest active star-forming region in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We find a PDMF slope of Gamma = -1.43 $\pm$ 0.18 in the mass range 0.8-60 Msun, in excellent agreement with the Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) in the solar neighborhood. Caveats on the conversion of the PDMF to the IMF are discussed. The PDMF slope changes, as a function of the radial distance from the center of the NGC 346 star cluster, indicating a segregation of the most massive stars. This segregation is likely primordial considering the young age (~ 3 Myr) of NGC 346, and its clumpy structure which suggests that the cluster has likely not had sufficient time to relax. Comparing our results for NGC 346 with those derived for other star clusters in the SMC and the Milky Way (MW), we conclude that, while the star formation process might depend on the local cloud conditions, the IMF does not seem to be affected by general environmental effects such as galaxy type, metallicity, and dust content.

	Abstract = {In this photometric study of the stellar association LH 95 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) we focus on the pre-main-sequence (PMS) population in order to construct, for the first time, the subsolar initial mass function (IMF) in the LMC. The basis for this investigation consists of the deepest photometry ever performed in the LMC with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. We improve our catalog of point sources obtained with ACS (Paper I). We carry out a Monte Carlo technique to subtract the contribution of the general field of LMC. We isolate the central region in the observed area of the association, as the part characterized by the highest concentration of PMS stars. We analyze the reddening distribution of the system in order to obtain the mean value of extinction and we study the mass function of its field-subtracted population. For this purpose, we introduce a new set of evolutionary models, derived from the calculations on the evolution of PMS stars by Siess and collaborators. We use these models with our observations of LH 95 to derive the IMF of the system. This mass function is reliably constructed for stars with masses down to sime0.43 M sun, the lowest mass ever observed within reasonable completeness in the Magellanic Clouds. Consequently, its construction offers an outstanding improvement in our understanding of the low-mass star formation in the LMC. The system IMF of LH 95 shows a definite change in its slope for masses M lsim 1 M sun, where it becomes more shallow. In general, the shape of this IMF agrees very well with a multiple power law, as the typical Galactic IMF, down to the subsolar regime. The change in the slope ("the knee") of our IMF at ~1 M sun also agrees with the average Galactic IMF. As far as the slope of this system IMF is concerned, it is found to be somewhat more shallow than the corresponding "classical" Galactic IMF in the subsolar regime, probably due to unresolved binarity, while for stars with M gsim 1 M sun it becomes slightly steeper. We do not find significant differences in the shape of the overall IMF of LH 95 from that of each of the three individual subclusters of the association. This clearly suggests that the IMF of LH 95 is not subject to local variability.

	Abstract = {Aims.We used the deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of five rich LMC clusters (NGC 1805, NGC 1818, NGC 1831, NGC 1868, and Hodge 14) observed with HST/WFPC2 to derive their present day mass function (PDMF) and its variation with position within the cluster.  Methods: .The PDMF was parameterized as a power law in the available main-sequence mass range of each cluster, typically 0.9 ⪅ m/M&sun; ⪅ 2.5; its slope was determined at different positions spanning from the very centre out to several core radii. The CMDs in the central regions of the clusters were carefully studied earlier, resulting in accurate age, metallicity, distance modulus, and reddening values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was determined in annuli by following two distinct methods: 1) a power law fit to the PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity function (LF); 2) a statistical comparison between observed and model CMDs. In the second case, alpha is a free input parameter in the CMD modelling process where we incorporate photometric errors and the effect of binarity as a fraction of unresolved binaries (f{bin}=100%) with random pairing of masses from the same PDMF. Results: .In all clusters, significant mass segregation is found from the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha ⪅ 1.8 for R <= 1.0 R{core} and alpha ˜ Salpeter inside R=2 ˜ 3 R{core} (except for Hodge 14, where alpha ˜ Salpeter for R ˜ 4 R{core}). The results are robust in the sense that they hold true for both methods used. The CMD method reveals that unresolved binaries flatten the PDMF obtained form the systemic LF, but this effect is smaller than the uncertainties in the alpha determination. For each cluster we estimated dynamical ages inside the core and for the entire system. In both cases we found a trend in the sense that older clusters have flatter PDMF, consistent with a dynamical mass segregation and stellar evaporation.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the star formation history and the initial mass function (IMF) using the age and mass derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and from color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We also examined the physical and structural parameters of more than 1000 pre-main-sequence stars in NGC 2264 using the online SED fitting tool (SED fitter) of Robitaille et al. We have compared the physical parameters of central stars from SED fitter and other methods. The temperature of the central star is, in many cases, much higher than that expected from its spectral type. The mass and age from SED fitter are not well matched with those from CMDs. We have made some suggestions to improve the accuracy of temperature estimates in the SED fitter. In most cases, these parameters of individual stars from the SED fitter in a star-forming region (SFR) or in the whole cluster showed nearly no systematic variation with age or with any other relevant parameter. On the other hand, the median properties of stars in NGC 2264 SFRs showed an evident evolutionary effect and were interrelated to each other. Such differences are caused by a larger age spread within an SFR than between them. The cumulative distribution of stellar ages showed a distinct difference among SFRs. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gave a very low probability of them being from the same population. The results indicate that star formation in NGC 2264 started at the surface region (Halo and Field regions) about 6-7 Myr ago, propagated into the molecular cloud and finally triggered the recent star formation in the Spokes cluster. The kind of sequential star formation that started in the low-density surface region (Halo and Field regions) implies that star formation in NGC 2264 was triggered by an external source. The IMF of NGC 2264 was determined in two different ways. One method used the stellar mass from the SED fitting tool, the other used the stellar mass from CMDs. The first IMF showed a distinct peak at m ≈ 2 M sun, but the second did not. We attribute the peak as an artifact of the SED fitting tool because there is no such IMF with a peak at m ≈ 2 M sun. The slope of the IMF of NGC 2264 for massive stars (log m >= 0.5) is -1.7 $\pm$ 0.1, which is somewhat steeper than the so-called standard Salpeter-Kroupa IMF. We also present data for 79 young brown dwarf candidates.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of deep high-resolution imaging performed with Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)/HRC@HST in the most active region of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4214. We resolved the stellar populations of five young massive clusters and their surrounding galactic field. The star formation history of this region is characterized by two main bursts occurred within the last 500 Myr, with the oldest episode spread out across an area larger than that covered by the most recent one. The ages derived for the analysed clusters cover a wide range within 6.4 < log t/yr < 8.1 in agreement with those predicted by recent analyses based on integrated photometry. The comparison between the mass of the young associations and that of the surrounding field population with similar ages indicates a high cluster formation efficiency (Gamma ˜ 33 per cent) which decreases when old populations are considered. The mass function of the major assembly has been found to be slightly flatter than the Salpeter law with a hint of mass segregation. We found no clear signatures of multiple stellar populations in the two young (log t/yr < 6.8) associations where we were able to resolve their innermost region. The masses and sizes of three clusters indicate that at least one of them could evolve towards a globular cluster-like structure.},

	Abstract = {Using high-resolution (R~22,000) near-infrared (1.51-1.75 mum) spectra from Keck Observatory, we measure the kinematic masses of two super-star clusters in M82. Cross-correlation of the spectra with template spectra of cool evolved stars gives stellar velocity dispersions of sigmar=15.9+/-0.8 km s-1 for J0955505+694045 (MGG-9) and sigmar=11.4+/-0.8 km s-1 for J0955502+694045 (MGG-11). The cluster spectra are dominated by the light of red supergiants and correlate most closely with template supergiants of spectral types M0 and M4.5. King model fits to the observed profiles of the clusters in archival Hubble Space Telescope/Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectometer images give half-light radii of rhp=2.6+/-0.4 pc for MGG-9 and rhp=1.2+/-0.17 pc for MGG-11. Applying the virial theorem, we determine masses of 1.5+/-0.3×106 Msolar for MGG-9 and 3.5+/-0.7×105 Msolar for MGG-11 (where the quoted errors include sigmar, rhp, and the distance). Population synthesis modeling suggests that MGG-9 is consistent with a standard initial mass function (IMF), whereas MGG-11 appears to be deficient in low-mass stars relative to a standard IMF. There is, however, evidence of mass segregation in the clusters, in which case the virial mass estimates would represent lower limits.  Based on observations made at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

@article{Bastian:2006kz,
	Abstract = {We present high-dispersion spectra of two extremely massive star clusters in galactic merger remnants, obtained using the UVES spectrograph mounted on the ESO Very Large Telescope. One cluster, W30, is located in the ~500 Myr old merger remnant NGC 7252 and has a velocity dispersion and effective radius of sigma=27.5$\pm$2.5 km s-1 and Reff=9.3$\pm$1.7 pc, respectively. The other cluster, G114, located in the ~3 Gyr old merger remnant NGC 1316, is much more compact, Reff=4.08$\pm$0.55 pc, and has a velocity dispersion of sigma=42.1$\pm$2.8 km s-1. These measurements allow an estimate of the virial mass of the two clusters, yielding Mdyn(W30)=1.59($\pm$0.26)× 10^7 M&sun; and Mdyn(G114)=1.64($\pm$0.13)× 10^7 M&sun;. Both clusters are extremely massive, being more than three times heavier than the most massive globular clusters in the Galaxy. For both clusters we measure light-to-mass ratios, which when compared to simple stellar population (SSP) models of the appropriate age, are consistent with a Kroupa-type stellar mass function. Using measurements from the literature we find a strong age dependence on how well SSP models (with underlying Kroupa or Salpeter-type stellar mass functions) fit the light-to-mass ratio of clusters. Based on this result we suggest that the large scatter in the light-to-mass ratio of the youngest clusters is not due to variations in the underlying stellar mass function, but instead to the rapidly changing internal dynamics of young clusters. Based on sampling statistics we argue that while W30 and G114 are extremely massive, they are consistent with being the most massive clusters formed in a continuous power-law cluster mass distribution. Finally, based on the positions of old globular clusters, young massive clusters (YMCs), ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and dwarf-globular transition objects (DGTOs) in kappa-space we conclude that 1) UCDs and DGTOs are consistent with the high mass end of star clusters and 2) YMCs occupy a much larger parameter space than old globular clusters, consistent with the idea of preferential disruption of star clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of the stellar cluster M82F, using multiband high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and deep ground-based optical slit and integral field spectroscopy. Using the imaging, we create colour maps of the cluster and surrounding region in order to search for substructure. We find a large amount of substructure, which we interpret as the result of differential extinction across the projected face of the cluster. With this interpretation, we are able to construct a spatially resolved extinction map across the cluster which is used to derive the intrinsic flux distribution. Fitting cluster profiles (King and Elson, Fall & Freeman) to the intrinsic images, we find that the cluster is 15-30 per cent larger than previous estimates, and that no strong evidence of mass segregation in this cluster exists. Using the optical spectra, we find that the age of M82F is 60-80 Myr and from its velocity conclude that the cluster is not physically associated with a large HII region that it is projected upon, both in agreement with previous studies. The reconstructed integral field maps show that that majority of the line emission comes from a nearby HII region. The spatial dependence of the line widths (implying the presence of multiple components) measured corresponds to the extinction map derived from photometry, indicating that the gas/dust clouds responsible for the extinction are also partially ionized. Even with the wealth of observations presented here, we do not find a conclusive solution to the problem of the high light-to-mass ratio previously found for this cluster and its possible top-heavy stellar initial mass function.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained high-dispersion spectra for four massive star clusters in the dwarf irregular galaxies NGC 4214 and NGC 4449, using the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I telescope. Combining the velocity dispersions of the clusters with structural parameters and photometry from images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, we estimate mass-to-light (M/L) ratios and compare these with simple stellar population models in order to constrain the stellar mass functions (MFs) of the clusters. For all clusters we find M/L values that are similar to or slightly higher than for a Kroupa MF and thereby rule out any MF that is deficient in low-mass stars compared with a Kroupa-type MF. The four clusters have virial masses ranging between 2.1×105 and 1.5×106Msolar, half-light radii between 3.0 and 5.2 pc, estimated core densities in the range 2×103 to 2×105Msolarpc-3, and ages between 200 and 800 Myr. We also present new high-dispersion near-infrared spectroscopy for a luminous young (~15 Myr) cluster in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946, which we have previously observed with HIRES. The new measurements in the infrared agree well with previous estimates of the velocity dispersion for this cluster, yielding a mass of about 1.7×106Msolar. Including an improved estimate of the reddening toward this cluster, the new data yield an M/L in excellent agreement with a Kroupa-type MF also for this cluster. The properties of the clusters studied here are all consistent with the clusters being young versions of the old globular clusters found around all major galaxies.  Based on data obtained at the W.

	Abstract = {We investigate the initial mass function and mass segregation in super star cluster M82-F with high-resolution Keck NIRSPEC echelle spectroscopy. Cross-correlation with template supergiant spectra provides the velocity dispersion of the cluster, enabling measurement of the kinematic (virial) mass of the cluster when combined with sizes from NICMOS and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) images. We find a mass of 6.6+/-0.9×105Msolar based on near-IR light and 7.0+/-1.2×105Msolar based on optical light. Using PSF-fitting photometry, we derive the cluster's light-to-mass (L/M) ratio in both near-IR and optical light and compare to population-synthesis models. The ratios are inconsistent with a normal stellar initial mass function for the adopted age of 40-60 Myr, suggesting a deficiency of low-mass stars within the volume sampled. King model light profile fits to new Hubble Space Telescope ACS images of M82-F, in combination with fits to archival near-IR images, indicate mass segregation in the cluster. As a result, the virial mass represents a lower limit on the mass of the cluster.  Based on observations made at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

Here I discuss what is involved in identifying various kinds of massive stars in nearby galaxies: the hydrogen-burning O-type stars and their evolved He-burning evolutionary descendants, the luminous blue variables, red supergiants, and Wolf-Rayet stars. Primarily I review what our knowledge of the massive star population in nearby galaxies has taught us about stellar evolution and star formation. I show that the current generation of stellar evolutionary models do well at matching some of the observed features and provide a look at the sort of new observational data that will provide a benchmark against which new models can be evaluated.},

	Abstract = {Star clusters projected on to dense stellar fields in general require field-star (FS) decontamination to confirm their nature and derive intrinsic photometric and structural fundamental parameters. This work focuses on the open clusters (OCs) or candidates NGC5715, Lyng{\aa}4, Lyng{\aa}9, Trumpler23, Trumpler26 and Czernik37 which are projected within and , against crowded bulge and/or disc fields. To tackle these difficult objects we develop a colour-magnitude diagram FS-decontamination algorithm based on 2MASS J, (J - H) and (J - Ks) data, and respective uncertainties, to detect cluster star excesses over the background. On the other hand, colour-magnitude filters are used to build stellar radial density profiles and mass functions. The results convey compelling evidence that Lyng{\aa}9 and Czernik37 are intermediate-age OCs, and their fundamental parameters are measured for the first time. Trumpler23 is a particularly challenging object, since besides high background level, its field presents variable absorption in near-infrared bands. We confirm it to be an intermediate-age OC. Trumpler26 is studied in more detail than in previous works, while NGC5715 and Lyng{\aa}4 have fundamental parameters determined for the first time. These OCs are located 0.9-1.6kpc within the solar circle, with ages similar to that of the Hyades. Structurally, they are well described by King profiles. In all cases, core and limiting radii are significantly smaller than those of nearby OCs outside the solar circle. We test the effect of background levels on cluster radii determinations by means of simulations. They indicate that for central clusters, radii may be underestimated by about 10-20 per cent, which suggests that the small sizes measured for the present sample reflect as well intrinsic properties related to dynamical evolution effects. The objects probably have been suffering important tidal effects that may have accelerated dynamical evolution, especially in Czernik37, the innermost object.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We present results of a photometric survey whose aim was to derive structural and astrophysical parameters for 42 open clusters. While our sample is definitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy, it does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow for simple statistical considerations. Methods: BV wide-field CCD photometry was obtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical evolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were determined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and distances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass function was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation effect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. Results: This study reports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42 observed open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed clusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate. The core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is 3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's mass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical evolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is similar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of evaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass segregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the dynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log({age}) = 8. Low-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log({age}) = 8.5 and not younger than one relaxation time.  Tables 1-5 are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {We present a new measurement of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) based on ultra-deep, high-resolution photometry of >5000 stars in the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys observations reveal this rich, cospatial population behind the foreground globular cluster 47 Tuc, which we targeted for 121 HST orbits. The stellar main sequence of the SMC is measured in the F606W, F814W color-magnitude diagram down to ~30th magnitude, and is cleanly separated from the foreground star cluster population using proper motions. We simulate the SMC population by extracting stellar masses (single and unresolved binaries) from specific IMFs and converting those masses to luminosities in our bandpasses. The corresponding photometry for these simulated stars is drawn directly from a rich cloud of 4 million artificial stars, thereby accounting for the real photometric scatter and completeness of the data. Over a continuous and well-populated mass range of M = 0.37-0.93 M &sun; (e.g., down to a ~75% completeness limit at F606W = 28.7), we demonstrate that the IMF is well represented by a single power-law form with slope alpha = -1.90 (+0.15 -0.10) (3sigma error) (e.g., dN/dMvprop M alpha). This is shallower than the Salpeter slope of alpha = -2.35, which agrees with the observed stellar luminosity function at higher masses. Our results indicate that the IMF does not turn over to a more shallow power-law form within this mass range. We discuss implications of this result for the theory of star formation, the inferred masses of galaxies, and the (lack of a) variation of the IMF with metallicity.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with proposal GO-11677.},

I conclude that whilst it is possible that the low-mass IMFs deduced from the field and most young clusters are similar, there are too many problems to be sure; there are examples of low-mass cluster IMFs that appear to be very discrepant and the IMFs for brown dwarfs in the field and young clusters have yet to be reconciled convincingly.},

@article{Reid:2002zn,
	Abstract = {We have used new astrometric and spectroscopic observations to refine the volume-complete sample of M dwarfs defined in previous papers in this series. With the addition of Hipparcos astrometry, our revised VC2 sample includes 558 main-sequence stars in 448 systems. Analysis of that data set shows no evidence of any systematic kinematic bias. Combining those data with a Hipparcos-based sample of AFGK dwarfs within 25 pc of the Sun, we have derived the solar neighborhood luminosity function, Phi(MV), for stars with absolute magnitudes between -1 and +17. Using empirical and semiempirical mass-MV relations, we transform Phi(MV) to the present-day mass function, psi(M) (=dN/dM). Depending on the mass-luminosity calibration adopted, psi(M) can be represented by either a two-component or a three-component power law. In either case, the power-law index alpha has a value of ~1.3 at low masses (0.1 Msolar<M<0.7 Msolar), and the local mass density of main-sequence stars is ~0.031 Msolar pc-3. We have converted psi(M) to an estimate of the initial mass function, Psi(M), by allowing for stellar evolution, the density law perpendicular to the plane, and the local mix of stellar populations. The results give alpha=1.1-1.3 at low masses and alpha=2.5-2.8 at high masses, with the change in slope lying between 0.7 and 1.1 Msolar. Finally, the (U,W) velocity distributions of both the VC2 sample and the fainter (MV>4) stars in the Hipparcos 25 pc sample are well represented by two-component Gaussian distributions, with ~10% of the stars in the higher velocity dispersion component. We suggest that the latter component is the thick disk, and we offer a possible explanation for the relatively low velocity dispersions shown by ultracool dwarfs.  Based partly on observations made at the 60 inch (1.5 m) telescope at Palomar Mountain, which is jointly owned by the California Institute of Technology and the Carnegie Institution of Washington.},

	Abstract = {We report on new measurements of the luminosity function (LF) and mass function (MF) of field low-mass dwarfs derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 photometry. The analysis incorporates ~15 million low-mass stars (0.1 {\cal M}_\odot  {\cal M} < 0.8\,{\cal M}_\odot), spread over 8400 deg2. Stellar distances are estimated using new photometric parallax relations, constructed from ugriz photometry of nearby low-mass stars with trigonometric parallaxes. We use a technique that simultaneously measures Galactic structure and the stellar LF from 7 < Mr < 16. We compare the LF to previous studies and convert to an MF using the mass-luminosity relations of Delfosse et al. The system MF, measured over -1.0< log {\cal M} / {\cal M}_\odot <-0.1, is well described by a lognormal distribution with {\cal M}_{\circ } = 0.25 {\cal M}_\odot. We stress that our results should not be extrapolated to other mass regimes. Our work generally agrees with prior low-mass stellar MFs and places strong constraints on future theoretical star formation studies.},

	Abstract = {The universality of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is tested using Bayesian statistics with a sample of eight young Galactic stellar clusters (IC 348, ONC, NGC 2024, NGC 6611, NGC 2264, rho Ophiuchi, Chameleon I, and Taurus). We infer the posterior probability distribution function (pPDF) of the IMF parameters when the likelihood function is described by a tapered power-law function, a lognormal distribution at low masses coupled to a power law at higher masses, and a multicomponent power-law function. The intercluster comparison of the pPDFs of the IMF parameters for each likelihood function shows that these distributions do not overlap within the 1sigma uncertainty level. Furthermore, the most probable values of the IMF parameters for most of the clusters deviate substantially from their values for the Galactic field stellar IMF. We also quantify the effects of taking into account the completeness correction as well as the uncertainties on the measured masses. The inclusion of the former affects the inferred pPDFs of the slope of the IMF at the low-mass end while considering the latter affects the pPDFs of the slope of the IMF in the intermediate- to high-mass regime. As variations are observed in all of the IMF parameters at once and for each of the considered likelihood functions, even for completeness corrected samples, we argue that the observed variations are real and significant, at least for the sample of eight clusters considered in this work. The results presented here clearly show that the IMF is not universal.},

	Abstract = {The h and chi Per ``double cluster'' is examined using wide-field (0.98d×0.98d) CCD UBV imaging supplemented by optical spectra of several hundred of the brightest stars. Restricting our analysis to near the cluster nuclei, we find identical reddenings [E(B-V)=0.56+/-0.01], distance moduli (11.85+/-0.05), and ages (12.8+/-1.0 Myr) for the two clusters. In addition, we find an initial mass function slope for each of the cluster nuclei that is quite normal for high-mass stars, Gamma=-1.3+/-0.2, indistinguishable from a Salpeter value. We derive masses of 3700 Msolar (h) and 2800 Msolar (chi) integrating the present-day mass function from 1 to 120 Msolar. There is evidence of mild mass segregation within the cluster cores. Our data are consistent with the stars having formed at a single epoch; claims to the contrary are very likely due to the inclusion of the substantial population of early-type stars located at similar distances in the Perseus spiral arm, in addition to contamination by G and K giants at various distances. We discuss the uniqueness of the double cluster, citing other examples of such structures in the literature but concluding that the nearly identical nature of the two cluster cores is unusual. We fail to settle the long-standing controversy regarding whether or not the double cluster is the core of the Per OB1 association and argue that this may be unanswerable with current techniques. We also emphasize the need for further work on the pre-main-sequence population of this nearby and highly interesting region.},

	Abstract = {We compare the observed size distribution of circumstellar discs in the Orion Trapezium cluster with the results of N-body simulations in which we incorporated an heuristic prescription for the evolution of these discs. In our simulations, the sizes of stellar discs are affected by close encounters with other stars (with discs). We find that the observed distribution of disc sizes in the Orion Trapezium cluster is excellently reproduced by truncation due to dynamical encounters alone. The observed distribution appears to be a sensitive measure of the past dynamical history of the cluster, and therewith on the conditions of the cluster at birth. The best comparison between the observed disc-size distribution and the simulated distribution is realized with a cluster of N = 2500 $\pm$ 500 stars with a half-mass radius of about 0.5 pc in virial equilibrium (with a virial ratio of Q = 0.5, or somewhat colder Q ~= 0.3), and with a density structure according to a fractal dimension of F ~= 1.6. Simulations with these parameters reproduce the observed distribution of circumstellar discs in about 0.2-0.5 Myr. We conclude that the distribution of disk sizes in the Orion Trapezium cluster is the result of dynamical interactions in the early evolution of the cluster.},

@article{Vincke:2015wl,
	Abstract = {Context. Most stars are born in clusters, thus the protoplanetary discs surrounding the newly formed stars might be influenced by this environment. Isolated star-disc encounters have previously been studied, and it was shown that very close encounters are necessary to completely destroy discs. However, relatively distant encounters are still able to change the disc size considerably.  Aims: We quantify the importance of disc-size reduction that is due to stellar encounters in an entire stellar population.  Methods: We modelled young, massive clusters of different densities using the code Nbody6 to determine the statistics of stellar encounter parameters. In a second step, we used these parameters to investigate the effect of the environments on the disc size. For this purpose, we performed a numerical experiment with an artificial initial disc size of 105 AU.  Results: We quantify to which degree the disc size is more sensitive to the cluster environment than to the disc mass or frequency. We show that in all investigated clusters a large portion of discs is significantly reduced in size. After 5 Myr, the fraction of discs smaller than 1000 AU in ONC-like clusters with an average number density of ̅rhocluster ~ 60pc-3, the fraction of discs smaller than 1000 AU is 65%, while discs smaller than 100 AU make up 15%. These fractions increase to 84% and 39% for discs in denser clusters like IC 348 (̅rhocluster ~ 500pc-3). Even in clusters with a density four times lower than in the ONC (̅rhocluster ~ 15pc-3), about 43% of all discs are reduced to sizes below 1000 AU and roughly 9% to sizes below 100 AU.  Conclusions: For any disc in the ONC that initially was larger than 1000 AU, the probability to be truncated to smaller disc sizes as a result of stellar encounters is quite high. Thus, among other effects, encounters are important in shaping discs and potentially forming planetary systems in stellar clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of protoplanetary disks ("proplyds") in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We imaged five individual fields at 856 mum containing 22 Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-identified proplyds and detected 21 of them. Eight of those disks were detected for the first time at submillimeter wavelengths, including the most prominent, well-known proplyd in the entire Orion Nebula, 114-426. Thermal dust emission in excess of any free-free component was measured in all but one of the detected disks, and ranged between 1 and 163 mJy, with resulting disk masses of 0.3-79 M jup. An additional 26 stars with no prior evidence of associated disks in HST observations were also imaged within the 5 fields, but only 2 were detected. The disk mass upper limits for the undetected targets, which include OB stars, theta1 Ori C, and theta1 Ori F, range from 0.1 to 0.6 M jup. Combining these ALMA data with previous Submillimeter Array observations, we find a lack of massive (gsim3 M jup) disks in the extreme-UV-dominated region of Orion, within 0.03 pc of theta1 Ori C. At larger separations from theta1 Ori C, in the far-UV-dominated region, there is a wide range of disk masses, similar to what is found in low-mass star forming regions. Taken together, these results suggest that a rapid dissipation of disk masses likely inhibits potential planet formation in the extreme-UV-dominated regions of OB associations, but leaves disks in the far-UV-dominated regions relatively unaffected.},

@article{Lada:2000jf,
	Abstract = {We report the results of a sensitive near-infrared JHKL imaging survey of the Trapezium cluster in Orion. We use the JHKL colors to obtain a census of infrared excess stars in the cluster. Of (391) stars brighter than 12th magnitude in the K and L bands, 80%+/-7% are found to exhibit detectable infrared excess on the J-H, K-L color-color diagram. Examination of a subsample of 285 of these stars with published spectral types yields a slightly higher infrared excess fraction of 85%. We find that 97% of the optical proplyds in the cluster exhibit excess in the JHKL color-color diagram indicating that the most likely origin of the observed infrared excesses is from circumstellar disks. We interpret these results to indicate that the fraction of stars in the cluster with circumstellar disks is between 80%-85%, confirming earlier published suggestions of a high disk fraction for this young cluster. Moreover, we find that the probability of finding an infrared excess around a star is independent of stellar mass over essentially the entire range of the stellar mass function down to the hydrogen burning limit. Consequently, the vast majority of stars in the Trapezium cluster appear to have been born with circumstellar disks and the potential to subsequently form planetary systems, despite formation within the environment of a rich and dense stellar cluster. We identify 78 stars in our sample characterized by K-L colors suggestive of deeply embedded objects. The spatial distribution of these objects differs from that of the rest of the cluster members and is similar to that of the dense molecular cloud ridge behind the cluster. About half of these objects are detected in the short wavelength (J and H) bands, and these are found to be characterized by extreme infrared excess. This suggests that many of these sources could be protostellar in nature. If even a modest fraction (i.e., ~50%) of these objects are protostars, then star formation could be continuing in the molecular ridge at a rate comparable to that which produced the foreground Trapezium cluster.},

	Abstract = {In an attempt to determine the nature of the enigmatic cocoon stars in the Quintuplet Cluster, we have obtained mid-infrared imaging and spectrophotometry of the cluster, using the CAM and SWS instruments on ISO, using SpectroCam-10 on the Palomar 5 m telescope, and NICMOS on HST. The spectra show smooth continua with various dust and ice absorption features. These features are all consistent with an interstellar origin, and there is no clear evidence for any circumstellar contribution to these features. We find no spectral line or feature that could elucidate the nature of these sources. Detailed modeling of the silicate absorption features shows that they are best reproduced by the mu Cep profile, which is typical of the interstellar medium, with tausil =~ 2.9. The high spatial resolution mid-IR images show that three of the five cocoon stars have spatially extended and asymmetric envelopes, with diameters of ~ 20 000 AUs. A reddening law similar to that of Lutz (\cite{lut99}) but with silicate features based on the mu Cep profile and normalized to our value of tausil is used to deredden the observed spectrophotometry. The dereddened energy distributions are characterised by temperatures of 750-925 K, somewhat cooler than determined from near IR data alone. Models of optically thin and geometrically thick dust shells, as used by Williams et al. (\cite{wil87}) for very dusty, late-type WC stars, reproduce the observed SEDs from 4 to 17mic , and imply shell luminosities of log (L/Lsun Msun) =~ 4.5-4.9 for the brightest four components. An analysis of the various suggestions proposed to explain the nature of the cocoon stars reveals serious problems with all the hypotheses, and the nature of these sources remains an enigma. ISO is an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States (especially the PI countries: France, Germany, The Netherlands and the UK) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA.},

@article{Hillier:1998df,
	Abstract = {Extensive modifications to the non-LTE radiative transfer code of Hillier have been made in order to improve the spectroscopic analysis of stars with stellar winds. The main improvement to the code is the inclusion of blanketing due to thousands of overlapping lines. To implement this effect, we have used the idea of super levels first pioneered by Anderson. In our approach, levels with similar excitation energies and levels are grouped together. Within this group, we assume that the departure coefficients are identical. Only the population (or equivalently, the departure coefficient) of the super level need be solved in order to fully specify the populations of the levels within a super level. Our approach is a natural extension of the single-level LTE assumption, and thus LTE is recovered exactly at depth.  In addition to the line blanketing modifications, the code has been improved significantly in other regards. In particular, the new code incorporates the effect of level dissolution, the influence of resonances in the photoionization cross sections, and the effect of Auger ionization. Electron scattering with a thermal redistribution can be considered, although it is normally treated coherently in the comoving frame (which still leads to redistribution in the observer's frame).  Several example calculations are described to demonstrate the importance of line blanketing on spectroscopic analysis. We find that the inclusion of blanketing modifies the strengths of some optical CNO lines in Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars by factors of 2-5. In particular, the strengths of the WC classification lines C III lambda5696 and C IV lambda5805 are both increased because of iron blanketing. This should help alleviate problems found with nonblanketed models, which were incapable of matching the strengths of these lines. We also find that, in the UV (1100-1800 {\AA}), the influence of Fe is readily seen in both emission and absorption. The emission is sensitive to the iron abundance and should allow, for the first time, Fe abundances to be deduced in W-R stars.  The improvements made to our code should greatly facilitate the spectroscopic analysis of stars with stellar winds. We will be able to determine the importance and influence of line blanketing, as well as of several other effects that have been included in the new code. It will also allow us to better determine W-R star parameters, such as luminosity, elemental abundances, wind velocity, and mass-loss rate. With future application to related objects, such as novae and supernovae, our new code should also improve our understanding of these objects with extended outflowing atmospheres.},

	Abstract = {A survey of results concerning the IMF derived from star counts is presented, including work up to, but not including, that presented in these proceedings. The situation regarding low-mass stars in the field and in clusters, high-mass stars and intermediate-mass stars in clusters and associations of the Milky Way and LMC, pre-main sequence objects in visible and embedded clusters, and the IMF in galaxies more distant than the Magellanic Clouds is discussed, with an emphasis on the sources of uncertainty. Most of these uncertainties, especially radial mass segregation and unresolved binaries, would steepen the true IMF relative to the apparent IMF. Several cases of apparently large variations in cluster IMFs are pointed out, and a graphical comparison of results for about 60 clusters shows a spread of at least unity in the logarithmic IMF index for all mass ranges above about 1 $M_{\sun}$. I conclude that either: 1. The uncertainties are so large that very little can be said about an average IMF or IMF variations; or 2. If the observations are taken at face value, there are strong indications of IMF variations, which do not seem to correlate with obvious environmental conditions like metallicity or stellar density. If there is an average IMF, I suggest that it is steepest at intermediate masses. If the variations are real, they offer a useful test of theoretical models.},

	Abstract = {The relative numbers of newborn stars of different masses in a galaxy (the initial mass function) determines whether the galaxy's interstellar gas goes mainly into long-lived low-mass stars, as in the disks of normal spiral galaxies, or into short-lived massive stars, as has been proposed for ``starburst'' galaxies,. The centre of the Milky Way is not a fully-fledged starburst region, but its star formation rate per unit volume of space is nevertheless roughly a thousand times that of the disk,. It is, however, very difficult to study the initial mass function near the centre, because the dust in the gas clouds obscures the starlight, and the relatively rare young stars are mixed with much more numerous older stars. Here we report high-resolution infrared observations of a compact cluster of stars in the central region of our Galaxy. We find approximately 100 young, massive main-sequence stars, several of which seem to be among the most massive in the Galaxy. This cluster may be a weak analogue of the large star clusters in starburst galaxies, which opens the possibility of studying the starburst phenomenon through a local example.},

@article{Olmi:2014xz,
	Abstract = {Context. Stars form in dense, dusty clumps of molecular clouds, but little is known about their origin, their evolution, and their detailed physical properties. In particular, the relationship between the mass distribution of these clumps (also known as the "clump mass function", or CMF) and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is still poorly understood.  Aims: To better understand how the CMF evolve toward the IMF and to discern the "true" shape of the CMF, large samples of bona-fide pre- and proto-stellar clumps are required. Two such datasets obtained from the Herschel infrared GALactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL) have been described in Paper I. Robust statistical methods are needed to infer the parameters describing the models used to fit the CMF and to compare the competing models themselves.  Methods: In this paper, we apply Bayesian inference to the analysis of the CMF of the two regions discussed in Paper I. First, we determine the posterior probability distribution for each of the fitted parameters. Then, we carry out a quantitative comparison of the models used to fit the CMF.  Results: We have compared several methods of sampling posterior distributions and calculating global likelihoods, and we have also analyzed the impact of the choice of priors and the influence of various constraints on the statistical conclusions for the values of model parameters. We find that both parameter estimation and model comparison depend on the choice of parameter priors.  Conclusions: Our results confirm our earlier conclusion that the CMFs of the two Hi-GAL regions studied here have very similar shapes but different mass scales. Furthermore, the lognormal model appears to better describe the CMF measured in the two Hi-GAL regions studied here. However, this preliminary conclusion is dependent on the choice of parameter priors.},

	Abstract = {Distances and extinction values are usually degenerate. To refine the distance to the general Galactic Center region, a carefully determined extinction law (taking into account the prevailing systematic errors) is urgently needed. We collected data for 55 classical Cepheids projected toward the Galactic Center region to derive the near- to mid-infrared extinction law using three different approaches. The relative extinction values obtained are AJ/AKs = 3.005, AH/AKs = 1.717, A[3.6]/AKs = 0.478, A[4.5]/AKs = 0.341, A[5.8]/AKs = 0.234, A[8.0]/AKs = 0.321, AW1/AKs = 0.506, and AW2/AKs = 0.340. We also calculated the corresponding systematic errors. Compared with previous work, we report an extremely low and steep mid-infrared extinction law. Using a seven-passband 'optimal distance' method, we improve the mean distance precision to our sample of 55 Cepheids to 4%. Based on four confirmed Galactic Center Cepheids, a solar Galactocentric distance of R_0 = 8.10\pm0.19\pm0.22 kpc is determined, featuring an uncertainty that is close to the limiting distance accuracy (2.8%) for Galactic Center Cepheids.},

	Abstract = {We propose a functional form for the initial mass function (IMF), the L3 IMF, which is a natural heavy-tailed approximation to the log-normal distribution. It is composed of a low-mass power law and a high-mass power law which are smoothly joined together. Three parameters are needed to achieve this. The standard IMFs of Kroupa (2001, 2002) and Chabrier (2003a) (single stars or systems) are essentially indistinguishable from this form. Compared to other three-parameter functions of the IMF, the L3 IMF has the advantage that the cumulative distribution function and many other characteristic quantities have a closed form, the mass generating function, for example, can be written down explicitly.},

The accuracy of the mass-magnitude relationships derived from the aforementioned theory is examined by comparison with recent, accurate observational relationships in the M-dwarf domain. The mass function is shown to flatten out below ~1 Msolar but to keep rising down to the bottom of the main sequence. Combining the present determination below 1 Msolar and J. M. Scalo's mass function for larger masses, we show that the mass function is well described over the entire stellar mass range, from ~100 Msolar to ~0.1 Msolar, by three functional forms, namely, a two-segment power law, a lognormal form, or an exponential form, all normalized to the Hipparcos sample at 0.8 Msolar. Integration of this mass function yields a reasonably accurate census of the entire stellar population in the Galactic disk and its volume and surface mass density.},

	Abstract = {Objects with radii of 10-100pc and masses in the range from 106 to 108Msolar have been discovered during the past decade. These so-called ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) constitute a transition between classical star clusters and elliptical galaxies in terms of radii, relaxation times and V-band mass-to-light ratios. Using new data, the increase of typical radii with mass for compact objects more massive than 106Msolar can be confirmed. There is a continuous transition to the typical, mass-independent radii of globular clusters (GCs). It can be concluded from the different relations between mass and radius of GCs and UCDs that at least their evolution must have proceeded differently, while the continuous transition could indicate a common formation scenario. The strong increase of the characteristic radii also implies a strong increase of the median two-body relaxation time, trel, which becomes longer than a Hubble time, tauH, in the mass interval between 106 and 107Msolar. This is also the mass interval where the highest stellar densities are reached. The mass-to-light ratios of UCDs are clearly higher than the ones of GCs, and the departure from mass-to-light ratios typical for GCs happens again at a mass of ~106Msolar. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies turn out to be total outliers compared to all other dynamically hot stellar systems regarding their dynamical mass-to-light ratios. Stellar population models were consulted in order to compare the mass-to-light ratios of the UCDs with theoretical predictions for dynamically unevolved simple stellar populations (SSPs), which are probably a good approximation to the actual stellar populations in the UCDs. The SSP models also allow us to account for the effects of metallicity on the mass-to-light ratio. It is found that the UCDs, if taken as a sample, have a tendency to higher mass-to-light ratios than would be expected from the SSP models assuming that the initial stellar mass function in the UCDs is the same as in resolved stellar populations. This can be interpreted in several ways: as a failure of state-of-the-art stellar evolution and stellar population modelling, as a presence of dark matter in UCDs or as stellar populations which formed with initial stellar mass functions different from the canonical one for resolved populations. But it is noteworthy that evidence for dark matter emerges only in systems with trel >~ tauH.},

	Abstract = {We combine previously published interferometric and single-dish data of relatively nearby massive dense cores that are actively forming stars to test whether their `fragmentation level' is controlled by turbulent or thermal support. We find no clear correlation between the fragmentation level and velocity dispersion, nor between the observed number of fragments and the number of fragments expected when the gravitationally unstable mass is calculated including various prescriptions for `turbulent support'. On the other hand, the best correlation is found for the case of pure thermal Jeans fragmentation, for which we infer a core formation efficiency around 13 per cent, consistent with previous works. We conclude that the dominant factor determining the fragmentation level of star-forming massive dense cores at 0.1 pc scale seems to be thermal Jeans fragmentation.},

	Abstract = {Systematic variations of the initial mass function (IMF) in early-type galaxies, and their connection with possible drivers such as velocity dispersion or metallicity, have been much debated in recent years. Strong lensing over galaxy scales combined with photometric and spectroscopic data provides a powerful method to constrain the stellar mass-to-light ratio and hence the functional form of the IMF. We combine photometric and spectroscopic constraints from the latest set of population synthesis models of Charlot & Bruzual, including a varying IMF, with a non-parametric analysis of the lens masses of 18 ETGs from the SLACS survey, with velocity dispersions in the range 200-300 km s-1. We find that very bottom-heavy IMFs are excluded. However, the upper limit to the bimodal IMF slope (mu ≲ 2.2, accounting for a dark matter fraction of 20-30 per cent, where mu = 1.3 corresponds to a Kroupa-like IMF) is compatible at the 1sigma level with constraints imposed by gravity-sensitive line strengths. A two-segment power-law parametrization of the IMF (Salpeter-like for high masses) is more constrained (Gamma ≲ 1.5, where Gamma is the power index at low masses) but requires a dark matter contribution of ≳25 per cent to reconcile the results with a Salpeter IMF. For a standard Milky Way-like IMF to be applicable, a significant dark matter contribution is required within 1Re. Our results reveal a large range of allowed IMF slopes, which, when interpreted as intrinsic scatter in the IMF properties of ETGs, could explain the recent results of Smith et al., who find Milky Way-like IMF normalizations in a few massive lensing ETGs.},

By comparing the stellar mass-to-light ratios estimated from stellar population synthesis and from JAM, we find a systematic variation of the initial mass function (IMF) similar to that in the earlier {{ATLAS}}3{{D}} results. Early-type galaxies (elliptical and lenticular) with lower velocity dispersions within one effective radius are consistent with a Chabrier-like IMF, while galaxies with higher velocity dispersions are consistent with a more bottom-heavy IMF such as the Salpeter IMF. Spiral galaxies have similar systematic IMF variations, but with slightly different slopes and larger scatters, due to the uncertainties caused by the higher gas fractions and extinctions for these galaxies. Furthermore, we examine the effects of stellar mass-to-light ratio gradients on our JAM modeling, and we find that the trends become stronger after considering the gradients.},

	Abstract = {Abell 1201 is a massive galaxy cluster at z = 0.169 with a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) that acts as a gravitational lens to a background source at z = 0.451. The lensing configuration is unusual, with a single bright arc formed at small radius (˜2 arcsec), where stars and dark matter are both expected to contribute substantially to the total lensing mass. Here, we present deep spectroscopic observations of the Abell 1201 BCG with MUSE (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer), which reveal emission lines from a faint counterimage, opposite to the main arc, at a radius of 0.6 arcsec. We explore models in which the lensing mass is described by a combination of stellar mass and a standard dark matter halo. The counterimage is not predicted in such models, unless the dark matter component is negligible, which would imply an extremely heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) in this galaxy. We consider two modifications to the model, which can produce the observed configuration without resorting to extreme IMFs. Imposing a radial gradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio, Upsilon, can generate a counterimage close to the observed position if Upsilon increases by ≳ 60 per cent within the inner ˜1 arcsec (e.g. variation from a Milky Way-like to a Salpeter-like IMF). Alternatively, the counterimage can be produced by introducing a central supermassive black hole. The required mass is MBH = (1.3 $\pm$ 0.6) × 1010 M&sun;, which is comparable to the largest black holes known to date, several of which are also hosted by BCGs. We comment on future observations that promise to distinguish between these alternatives.},

	Abstract = {We present new observations of the three nearest early-type galaxy (ETG) strong lenses discovered in the SINFONI Nearby Elliptical Lens Locator Survey (SNELLS). Based on their lensing masses, these ETGs were inferred to have a stellar initial mass function (IMF) consistent with that of the Milky Way, not the bottom-heavy IMF that has been reported as typical for high-sigma ETGs based on lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis techniques. We use these unique systems to test the consistency of IMF estimates derived from different methods. We first estimate the stellar M */L using lensing and stellar dynamics. We then fit high-quality optical spectra of the lenses using an updated version of the stellar population synthesis models developed by Conroy & van Dokkum. When examined individually, we find good agreement among these methods for one galaxy. The other two galaxies show 2-3sigma tension with lensing estimates, depending on the dark matter contribution, when considering IMFs that extend to 0.08 M &sun;. Allowing a variable low-mass cutoff or a nonparametric form of the IMF reduces the tension among the IMF estimates to <2sigma. There is moderate evidence for a reduced number of low-mass stars in the SNELLS spectra, but no such evidence in a composite spectrum of matched-sigma ETGs drawn from the SDSS. Such variation in the form of the IMF at low stellar masses (m ≲ 0.3 M &sun;), if present, could reconcile lensing/dynamical and spectroscopic IMF estimates for the SNELLS lenses and account for their lighter M */L relative to the mean matched-sigma ETG. We provide the spectra used in this study to facilitate future comparisons.},

	Abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF), which is often assumed to be universal across unresolved stellar populations, has recently been suggested to be ``bottom-heavy'' for massive ellipticals. In these galaxies, the prevalence of gravity-sensitive absorption lines (e.g., Na I and Ca II) in their near-IR spectra implies an excess of low-mass (m≲ 0.5 {M}&sun; ) stars over that expected from a canonical IMF observed in low-mass ellipticals. A direct extrapolation of such a bottom-heavy IMF to high stellar masses (m≳ 8 {M}&sun; ) would lead to a corresponding deficit of neutron stars and black holes, and therefore of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), per unit near-IR luminosity in these galaxies. Peacock et al. searched for evidence of this trend and found that the observed number of LMXBs per unit K-band luminosity (N/{L}K) was nearly constant. We extend this work using new and archival Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope observations of seven low-mass ellipticals where N/{L}K is expected to be the largest and compare these data with a variety of IMF models to test which are consistent with the observed N/{L}K. We reproduce the result of Peacock et al., strengthening the constraint that the slope of the IMF at m≳ 8 {M}&sun;  must be consistent with a Kroupa-like IMF. We construct an IMF model that is a linear combination of a Milky Way-like IMF and a broken power-law IMF, with a steep slope ({alpha }1=3.84) for stars <0.5 {M}&sun;  (as suggested by near-IR indices), and that flattens out ({alpha }2=2.14) for stars >0.5 {M}&sun; , and discuss its wider ramifications and limitations.},

@article{Vaughan:2018qp,
	Abstract = {We make radial measurements of stellar initial mass function (IMF) sensitive absorption features in the two massive early-type galaxies NGC 1277 and IC 843. Using the Oxford Short Wavelength Integral Field specTrogaph (SWIFT), we obtain resolved measurements of the Na I 0.82 and FeH 0.99 indices, amongst others, finding both galaxies show strong gradients in Na I absorption combined with flat FeH profiles at ˜0.4 {\AA}. We find these measurements may be explained by radial gradients in the IMF, appropriate abundance gradients in [Na/Fe] and [Fe/H], or a combination of the two, and our data are unable to break this degeneracy. We also use full spectral fitting to infer global properties from an integrated spectrum of each object, deriving a unimodal IMF slope consistent with Salpeter in IC 843 (x = 2.27 $\pm$ 0.17) but steeper than Salpeter in NGC 1277 (x = 2.69 $\pm$ 0.11), despite their similar FeH equivalent widths. Independently, we fit the strength of the FeH feature and compare to the E-MILES and CvD12 stellar population libraries, finding agreement between the models. The IMF values derived in this way are in close agreement with those from spectral fitting in NGC 1277 (x_{CvD}=2.59^{+0.25}_{-0.48}, x_{E-MILES}=2.77$\pm$ 0.31), but are less consistent in IC 843, with the IMF derived from FeH alone leading to steeper slopes than when fitting the full spectrum (x_{CvD}=2.57^{+0.30}_{-0.41}, x_{E-MILES}=2.72$\pm$ 0.25). This work highlights the importance of a large wavelength coverage for breaking the degeneracy between abundance and IMF variations, and may bring into doubt the use of the Wing-Ford band as an IMF index if used without other spectral information.},

	Abstract = {It is now well-established that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) can be determined from the absorption line spectra of old stellar systems, and this has been used to measure the IMF and its variation across the early-type galaxy population. Previous work focused on measuring the slope of the IMF over one or more stellar mass intervals, implicitly assuming that this is a good description of the IMF and that the IMF has a universal low-mass cutoff. In this work we consider more flexible IMFs, including two-component power laws with a variable low-mass cutoff and a general non-parametric model. We demonstrate with mock spectra that the detailed shape of the IMF can be accurately recovered as long as the data quality is high (S/N ≳ 300 {\AA}-1) and cover a wide wavelength range (0.4-1.0 mum). We apply these flexible IMF models to a high S/N spectrum of the center of the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 1407. Fitting the spectrum with non-parametric IMFs, we find that the IMF in the center shows a continuous rise extending toward the hydrogen-burning limit, with a behavior that is well-approximated by a power law with an index of -2.7. These results provide strong evidence for the existence of extreme (super-Salpeter) IMFs in the cores of massive galaxies.},

@article{van-Dokkum:2017bx,
	Abstract = {There is good evidence that the centers of massive early-type galaxies have a bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) compared to that of the Milky Way. Here we study the radial variation of the IMF within such galaxies, using a combination of high-quality Keck spectroscopy and a new suite of stellar population synthesis models that cover a wide range in metallicity. As in the previous studies in this series, the models are fitted directly to the spectra and treat all elemental abundance ratios as free parameters. Using newly obtained spectroscopy for six galaxies, including deep data extending to ˜ 1{R}{{e}} for the galaxies NGC 1407, NGC 1600, and NGC 2695, we find that the IMF varies strongly with galactocentric radius. For all six galaxies the IMF is bottom-heavy in the central regions, with average mass-to-light ratio ``mismatch'' parameter alpha \equiv {({\text{}}M/L)/({\text{}}M/L)}{MW}≈ 2.5 at R = 0. The IMF rapidly becomes more bottom-light with increasing radius, flattening off near the Milky Way value (alpha ≈ 1.1) at R> 0.4{R}{{e}}. A consequence is that the luminosity-weighted average IMF depends on the measurement aperture: within R={R}{{e}} we find < alpha {> }L=1.3{--}1.5, consistent with recent lensing and dynamical results from SLACS and {{ATLAS}}3{{D}}. Our results are also consistent with several earlier studies that were based on analyses of radial gradients of line indices. The observed IMF gradients support galaxy formation models in which the central regions of massive galaxies had a different formation history than their outer parts. Finally, we make use of the high signal-to-noise central spectra of NGC 1407 and NGC 2695 to demonstrate how we can disentangle IMF effects and abundance effects.},

	Abstract = {The current knowledge on the stellar IMF is documented. It is usuallydescribed as being invariant, but evidence to the contrary has emerged: it appears to become top-heavy when the star-formation rate density surpasses about 0.1 M_{odot}/(year {pc}3) ona pc scale and it may become increasingly bottom-heavy withincreasing metallicity and in increasingly massive elliptical galaxies. Itdeclines quite steeply below about 0.07 M_{odot } with brown dwarfs (BDs) and very low mass stars having their own IMF. The most massive star of mass m max formed in an embedded cluster with stellar mass M ecl correlates strongly with M ecl being a result of gravitation-driven but resource-limited growth and fragmentation-induced starvation. There is no convincing evidence whatsoeverthat massive stars do form in isolation. Massive stars form above a density threshold in embedded clusters which become saturated when m_{max} = m_{max{ast}}≈ 150 M_{odot } which appears to be the canonical physical upper mass limit of stars. Super-canonical massive stars arise naturally due to stellar mergers induced bystellar-dynamical encounters in binary-rich very young dense clusters.},

	Abstract = {The initial mass function (IMF) of the Arches cluster, which was formed a few million years ago in the harsh environment of the Galactic Centre (GC), has long been a target of interest to those who study the GC and the theory of star formation. The distinct star-forming conditions in the GC might have caused the cluster to have a shallower slope or an elevated lower mass cutoff in its IMF. But its mass function (MF) has been revealed only down to 1-2 M&sun; (the lower limit of resolved stars), and the low-end MF of the Arches is still unknown. To estimate the unresolved part of the Arches MF, we have devised a novel photometric method that involves the histogram of pixel intensities in the observed image, which contains information on the unresolved, faint stars. By comparing the pixel intensity histograms (PIHs) of numerous artificial images constructed from model IMFs with the observed PIH, we find that the best-fitting model IMF for the Arches cluster has a cutoff mass less than or similar to 0.1 M&sun; and a shape very close to that of the Kroupa MF. Our findings imply that the IMF of the Arches cluster is similar to those found in the Galactic disc.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of stellar masses that form in one star formation event in a given volume of space is called the initial mass function (IMF). The IMF has been estimated from low-mass brown dwarfs to very massive stars. Combining IMF estimates for different populations in which the stars can be observed individually unveils an extraordinary uniformity of the IMF. This general insight appears to hold for populations including present-day star formation in small molecular clouds, rich and dense massive star-clusters forming in giant clouds, through to ancient and metal-poor exotic stellar populations that may be dominated by dark matter. This apparent universality of the IMF is a challenge for star formation theory, because elementary considerations suggest that the IMF ought to systematically vary with star-forming conditions.},

	Abstract = {I describe a method to transform a set of stellar evolution tracks onto a uniform basis and then interpolate within that basis to construct stellar isochrones. This method accommodates a broad range of stellar types, from substellar objects to high-mass stars, and phases of evolution, from the pre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling sequence. I discuss situations in which stellar physics leads to departures from the otherwise monotonic relation between initial stellar mass and lifetime, and how these may be dealt with in isochrone construction. I close with convergence tests and recommendations for the number of points in the uniform basis and the mass between tracks in the original grid required to achieve a certain level accuracy in the resulting isochrones. The programs that implement these methods are free and open-source; they may be obtained from the project webpage.1},

	Abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open-source software instrument Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates ``on-the-fly'' from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESA's development.},

	Abstract = {Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

	Abstract = {Located within the central region of the Galaxy, the Arches cluster appears to be one of the youngest, densest and most massive stellar aggregates within the Milky Way. As such it has the potential to be a uniquely instructive laboratory for the study of star formation in extreme environments and the physics of very massive stars. In order to determine the fundamental physical properties of both cluster and constituent stars, we provide and analyse new HST+VLT near-IR datasets. Stacking multiple epochs of spectroscopy results in the deepest view of the cluster ever obtained, allowing us to to identify candidate giant and main sequence stars for the first time. All cluster members are found to be WNLh or O stars, with the smooth and continuous progression in spectral morphologies from O super-/hypergiants through to the WNLh cohort implying a direct evolutionary connection. Importantly no H-free Wolf-Rayets are found, while no products of binary interaction/mass-transfer may be unambiguously identified, despite the presence of massive binaries within the Arches. We infer a main sequence turn-off around O4-5V, corresponding to ~30-38Msun, while the eclipsing binary F2 implies current masses of ~80Msun and ~60Msun for the WNLh and O hypergiant cohorts, respectively. A cluster age of ~2-3Myr is suggested by the location of the main-sequence turn-off. While the absence of H-free Wolf-Rayets argues against the prior occurrence of SNe, such an age does accommodate such events for exceptionally massive stars. Future progress requires quantitative analysis of cluster members combined with additional spectroscopic observations to better constrain the binary population; nevertheless it is already abundantly clear that the Arches offers an unprecedented insight into the formation, evolution and death of the most massive stars Nature allows to form in the local universe (Abridged).},

	Abstract = {Context. The origin and dynamical evolution of star clusters is an important topic in stellar astrophysics. Several models have been proposed to understand the formation of bound and unbound clusters and their evolution, and these can be tested by examining the kinematical and dynamical properties of clusters over a wide range of ages and masses. Aims. We use the Gaia-ESO Survey products to study four open clusters (IC 2602, IC 2391, IC 4665, and NGC 2547) that lie in the age range between 20 and 50 Myr. Methods. We employ the gravity index $\gamma$ and the equivalent width of the lithium line at 6708 $\AA$, together with effective temperature $\rm{T_{eff}}$, and the metallicity of the stars in order to discard observed contaminant stars. Then, we derive the cluster radial velocity dispersions $\sigma_c$, the total cluster mass $\rm{M}_{tot}$, and the half mass radius $r_{hm}$. Using the $Gaia$-DR1 TGAS catalogue, we independently derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the clusters from the astrometric parameters of cluster members. Results. The intrinsic radial velocity dispersions derived by the spectroscopic data are larger than those derived from the TGAS data, possibly due to the different masses of the considered stars. Using $\rm{M}_{tot}$ and $r_{hm}$ we derive the virial velocity dispersion $\sigma_{vir}$ and we find that three out of four clusters are supervirial. This result is in agreement with the hypothesis that these clusters are dispersing, as predicted by the "residual gas expulsion" scenario. However, recent simulations show that the virial ratio of young star clusters may be overestimated if it is determined using the global velocity dispersion, since the clusters are not fully relaxed.},

	Abstract = {We report new Spitzer Space Telescope observations, using the IRAC and MIPS instruments, of the young (~3 Myr) sigma Orionis cluster. We identify 336 stars as members of the cluster, using optical and near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams. Using the spectral energy distribution slopes in the IRAC spectral range, we place objects into several classes: non-excess stars, stars with optically thick disks (such as classical T Tauri stars), class I (protostellar) candidates, and stars with ``evolved disks'' the last exhibit smaller IRAC excesses than optically thick disk systems. In general, this classification agrees with the location expected in IRAC-MIPS color-color diagrams for these objects. We find that the evolved disk systems are mostly a combination of objects with optically thick but nonflared disks, suggesting grain growth and/or settling, and transition disks, systems in which the inner disk is partially or fully cleared of small dust. In all, we identify seven transition disk candidates and three possible debris disk systems. As in other young stellar populations, the fraction of disks depends on the stellar mass, ranging from ~10% for stars in the Herbig Ae/Be mass range (>2 Msolar) to ~35% for those in the T Tauri mass range (1-0.1 Msolar). The IRAC infrared excesses found in stellar clusters and associations with and without central high-mass stars are similar, suggesting that external photoevaporation is not very important in many clusters. Finally, we find no correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the disk infrared excess, suggesting that the X-rays are not strongly affected by disk accretion.},

	Abstract = {We re-examine the observed near-infrared properties of T Tauri stars and interpret them with the aid of accretion disk models. Based upon a careful analysis of the dereddened near-infrared colors, we find that T Tauri stars exhibit a surprisingly narrow range in (J-H)/(H-K) and (H-K)/(K-L) color-color diagrams. We find that accretion disk models with a range of accretion rates (10(-8) Msun yr(-1) < Mdot < 10(-6) Msun yr(-1) ), inner-disk radii (1-6 R_*), and viewing angles can account for the distribution of intrinsic near-infrared excesses. If the assumptions upon which our models are based are correct, we find that: i) the disk accretion rates needed to explain the observations are consistent with those inferred from optical spectroscopic studies; and ii) inner-disk holes are required in order to explain the range of observed intrinsic near-infrared excesses. Our model results suggest that a given near-IR excess requires a minimum disk accretion rate, though larger accretion rates can be accommodated with specific combinations of inner disk hole size and viewing inclinations. Further, we combine optical veiling measurements, knowledge of stellar SEDs and reddening, in order to estimate infrared photometric flux excesses for our sample of T Tauri stars. Assuming a distribution of mass accretion rates inferred from optical veiling studies, and a random distribution of viewing inclinations, we examine the plausible range of inner-disk hole sizes. The absence of inner-disk holes predicts near-IR excesses larger than those observed. Inner-disk holes exclusively > 8R_* are inconsistent with the observations, whereas hole sizes between 2-6 R_* are well-matched to the data. Finally we examine the impact of our results on attempts to characterize the accretion properties of embedded young star clusters.},

	Abstract = {A precise extinction law is a critical input when interpreting observations of highly reddened sources such as young star clusters and the Galactic Center (GC). We use Hubble Space Telescope observations of a region of moderate extinction and a region of high extinction to measure the optical and near-infrared extinction law (0.8--2.2 mum). The moderate-extinction region is the young massive cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd1; A  Ks  ~ 0.6 mag), where 453 proper-motion selected main-sequence stars are used to measure the shape of the extinction law. To quantify the shape, we define the parameter {{ \mathcal S }}1/lambda , which behaves similarly to a color-excess ratio, but is continuous as a function of wavelength. The high-extinction region is the GC (A  Ks  ~ 2.5 mag), where 819 red clump stars are used to determine the normalization of the law. The best-fit extinction law is able to reproduce the Wd1 main-sequence colors, which previous laws misestimate by 10%--30%. The law is inconsistent with a single power law, even when only the near-infrared filters are considered, and has A F125W/A  Ks  and A F814W/A  Ks  values that are 18% and 24% higher than the commonly used Nishiyama et al. law, respectively. Using this law, we recalculate the Wd1 distance to be 3905 $\pm$ 422 pc from published observations of the eclipsing binary W13. This new extinction law should be used for highly reddened populations in the Milky Way, such as the Quintuplet cluster and Young Nuclear Cluster. A python code is provided to generate the law for future use.},

@article{Boone:2018dj,
	Abstract = {We have discovered an anomalous behavior of CCD readout electronics that affects their use in many astronomical applications. An offset in the digitization of the CCD output voltage that depends on the binary encoding of one pixel is added to pixels that are read out one, two and/or three pixels later. One result of this effect is the introduction of a differential offset in the background when comparing regions with and without flux from science targets. Conventional data reduction methods do not correct for this offset. We find this effect in 16 of 22 instruments investigated, covering a variety of telescopes and many different front-end electronics systems. The affected instruments include LRIS and DEIMOS on the Keck telescopes, WFC3-UVIS and STIS on HST, MegaCam on CFHT, SNIFS on the UH88 telescope, GMOS on the Gemini telescopes, HSC on Subaru, and FORS on VLT. The amplitude of the introduced offset is up to 4.5 ADU per pixel, and it is not directly proportional to the measured ADU level. We have developed a model that can be used to detect this "binary offset effect" in data and correct for it. Understanding how data are affected and applying a correction for the effect is essential for precise astronomical measurements.},

	Abstract = {We interpret the interstellar extinction observed toward the Galactic center (GC) in the wavelength range lambda = 1-20 mum. Its main feature is the flat extinction at 3-8 mum whose explanation is still a problem for cosmic dust models. We search for the structure and chemical composition of dust grains that could explain the observed extinction. In contrast to earlier works, we use laboratory measured optical constants and consider particles of different structures. We show that a mixture of compact grains of aromatic carbon and of some silicate is better suited for reproducing the flat extinction in comparison with essentially porous grains or aliphatic carbon particles. Metallic iron should be located inside the particle, I.e., it cannot form layers on silicate grains as the extinction curves then become very peculiar. We find a model including aromatic carbonaceous particles and three-layered particles with an olivine-type silicate core, a thin, very porous layer and a thin envelope of magnetite that provides a good (but still not perfect) fit to the observational data. We suggest that such silicate dust should be fresh, I.e., recently formed in the atmospheres of late-type stars in the central region of the Galaxy. We assume that this region has a radius of about 1 kpc and produces about half of the observed extinction. The remaining part of extinction is caused by a ``foreground'' material being practically transparent at lambda =4{--}8 mu {{m}}.},

	Abstract = {Red clump stars are fundamental distance indicators in astrophysics, although theoretical stellar models predict a dependence of absolute magnitudes with age. This effect is particularly strong below ˜2 Gyr, but even above this limit a mild age dependence is still expected. We use seismically identified red clump stars in the Kepler field for which we have reliable distances, masses, and ages from the SAGA survey, to first explore this effect. By excluding red clump stars with masses larger than 1.6 {M}&sun;  (corresponding to ages younger than 2 Gyr), we derive robust calibrations linking intrinsic colors to absolute magnitudes in the following photometric systems: Str{\"o}mgren by, Johnson BV, Sloan griz, 2MASS JHK  s , and WISE W1W2W3. With the precision achieved we also detect a slope of absolute magnitudes ˜ 0.020+/- 0.003 {mag} {{Gyr}}-1 in the infrared, implying that distance calibrations of clump stars can be off by up to ˜ 0.2 {mag} in the infrared (over the range from 2 to 12 Gyr) if their ages are unknown. Even larger uncertainties affect optical bands, because of the stronger interdependency of absolute magnitudes on colors and age. Our distance calibrations are ultimately based on asteroseismology, and we show how the distance scale can be used to test the accuracy of seismic scaling relations. Within the uncertainties our calibrations are in agreement with those built upon local red clumps with Hipparcos parallaxes, although we find a tension, which, if confirmed, would imply that scaling relations overestimate the radii of red clump stars by 2 $\pm$ 2%. Data releases post Gaia DR1 will provide an important testbed for our results.},

	Abstract = {We present uniformly measured star formation histories (SFHs) of 40 Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies based on color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis from archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We demonstrate that accurate SFHs can be recovered from CMDs that do not reach the oldest main sequence turn-off (MSTO), but emphasize that the oldest MSTO is critical for precisely constraining the earliest epochs of star formation. We find that: (1) the average lifetime SFHs of dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) can be approximated by an exponentially declining SFH with tau ~ 5 Gyr (2) lower luminosity dSphs are less likely to have extended SFHs than more luminous dSphs; (3) the average SFHs of dwarf irregulars (dIrrs), transition dwarfs, and dwarf ellipticals can be approximated by the combination of an exponentially declining SFH (tau ~ 3-4 Gyr) for lookback ages >10-12 Gyr ago and a constant SFH thereafter; (4) the observed fraction of stellar mass formed prior to z = 2 ranges considerably (80% for galaxies with M < 105 M &sun; to 30% for galaxies with M > 107 M &sun;) and is largely explained by environment; (5) the distinction between "ultra-faint" and "classical" dSphs is arbitrary; (6) LG dIrrs formed a significantly higher fraction of stellar mass prior to z = 2 than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies from Leitner and the SFHs from the abundance matching models of Behroozi et al. This may indicate higher than expected star formation efficiencies at early times in low mass galaxies. Finally, we provide all the SFHs in tabulated electronic format for use by the community.

The SFHs were derived by analyzing color-magnitude diagrams of resolved stellar populations in archival Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 imaging. We find: (1) lower-mass galaxies quench earlier than higher-mass galaxies; (2) inside of Rvirial there is no correlation between a satellite's current proximity to a massive host and its quenching epoch; and (3) there are hints of systematic differences in the quenching times of M31 and Milky Way (MW) satellites, although the sample size and uncertainties in the SFHs of M31 dwarfs prohibit definitive conclusions. Combined with results from the literature, we qualitatively consider the redshift evolution (z = 0-1) of the quenched galaxy fraction over ˜7 dex in stellar mass (104 ≲  {{M}\star } ≲  1011.5 {{M}&sun; }). The quenched fraction of all galaxies generally increases toward the present, with both the lowest and highest-mass systems exhibiting the largest quenched fractions at all redshifts. In contrast, galaxies between {{M}\star } ˜  108-1010 {{M}&sun; } have the lowest quenched fractions. We suggest that such intermediate-mass galaxies are the least efficient at quenching. Finally, we compare our quenching times with predictions for infall times for low-mass galaxies associated with the MW. We find that some of the lowest-mass satellites (e.g., CVn II, Leo IV) may have been quenched before infall, while higher-mass satellites (e.g., Leo I, Fornax) typically quench ˜1-4 Gyr after infall.

	Abstract = {NGC 796 is a massive young cluster located 59 kpc from us in the diffuse intergalactic medium of the 1/5-1/10 $Z_{\odot}$ Magellanic Bridge, allowing to probe variations in star formation and stellar evolution processes as a function of metallicity in a resolved fashion, providing a link between resolved studies of nearby solar-metallicity and unresolved distant metal-poor clusters located in high-redshift galaxies. In this paper, we present adaptive optics $gri$H$\alpha$ imaging of NGC 796 (at 0.5", which is ~0.14 pc at the cluster distance) along with optical spectroscopy of two bright members to quantify the cluster properties. Our aim is to explore if star formation and stellar evolution varies as a function of metallicity by comparing the properties of NGC 796 to higher metallicity clusters. We find from isochronal fitting of the cluster main sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram an age of 20$^{+12}_{-5}$ Myr. Based on the cluster luminosity function, we derive a top-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) with a slope $\alpha$ = 1.99$\pm$0.2, hinting at an metallicity and/or environmental dependence of the IMF which may lead to a top-heavy IMF in the early Universe. Study of the H$\alpha$ emission line stars reveals that Classical Be stars constitute a higher fraction of the total B-type stars when compared with similar clusters at greater metallicity, providing some support to the chemically homogeneous theory of stellar evolution. Overall, NGC 796 has a total estimated mass of 990$\pm200$ $M_{\odot}$, and a core radius of 1.4$\pm$0.3 pc which classifies it as a massive young open cluster, unique in the diffuse interstellar medium of the Magellanic Bridge.},

	Abstract = {Context. Absorption by molecules in the Earth's atmosphere strongly affects ground-based astronomical observations. The resulting absorption line strength and shape depend on the highly variable physical state of the atmosphere, i.e. pressure, temperature, and mixing ratio of the different molecules involved. Usually, supplementary observations of so-called telluric standard stars (TSS) are needed to correct for this effect, which is expensive in terms of telescope time. We have developed the software package molecfit to provide synthetic transmission spectra based on parameters obtained by fitting narrow ranges of the observed spectra of scientific objects. These spectra are calculated by means of the radiative transfer code LBLRTM and an atmospheric model. In this way, the telluric absorption correction for suitable objects can be performed without any additional calibration observations of TSS.  Aims: We evaluate the quality of the telluric absorption correction using molecfit with a set of archival ESO-VLT/X-Shooter visible and near-infrared spectra.  Methods: Thanks to the wavelength coverage from the U to the K band, X-Shooter is well suited to investigate the quality of the telluric absorption correction with respect to the observing conditions, the instrumental set-up, input parameters of the code, the signal-to-noise of the input spectrum, and the atmospheric profiles. These investigations are based on two figures of merit, Ioff and Ires, that describe the systematic offsets and the remaining small-scale residuals of the corrections. We also compare the quality of the telluric absorption correction achieved with molecfit to the classical method based on a telluric standard star.  Results: The evaluation of the telluric correction with molecfit shows a convincing removal of atmospheric absorption features. The comparison with the classical method reveals that molecfit performs better because it is not prone to the bad continuum reconstruction, noise, and intrinsic spectral features introduced by the telluric standard star.  Conclusions: Fitted synthetic transmission spectra are an excellent alternative to the correction based on telluric standard stars. Moreover, molecfit offers wide flexibility for adaption to various instruments and observing sites.  http://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/skytools/},

	Abstract = {Context. The interaction of the light from astronomical objects with the constituents of the Earth's atmosphere leads to the formation of telluric absorption lines in ground-based collected spectra. Correcting for these lines, mostly affecting the red and infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies on observations of specific stars obtained close in time and airmass to the science targets, therefore using precious observing time.  Aims: We present molecfit, a tool to correct for telluric absorption lines based on synthetic modelling of the Earth's atmospheric transmission. Molecfit is versatile and can be used with data obtained with various ground-based telescopes and instruments.  Methods: Molecfit combines a publicly available radiative transfer code, a molecular line database, atmospheric profiles, and various kernels to model the instrument line spread function. The atmospheric profiles are created by merging a standard atmospheric profile representative of a given observatory's climate, of local meteorological data, and of dynamically retrieved altitude profiles for temperature, pressure, and humidity. We discuss the various ingredients of the method, its applicability, and its limitations. We also show examples of telluric line correction on spectra obtained with a suite of ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments.  Results: Compared to previous similar tools, molecfit takes the best results for temperature, pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere above the observatory into account. As a result, the standard deviation of the residuals after correction of unsaturated telluric lines is frequently better than 2% of the continuum.  Conclusions: Molecfit is able to accurately model and correct for telluric lines over a broad range of wavelengths and spectral resolutions. The accuracy reached is comparable to or better than the typical accuracy achieved using a telluric standard star observation. The availability of such a general tool for telluric absorption correction may improve future observational and analysing strategies, as well as empower users of archival data.

	Abstract = {I present a technique to remove the residual OH airglow emission from near-infrared spectra. Historically, the need to subtract out the strong and variable OH airglow emission lines from 1 to 2.5-mum spectra has imposed severe restrictions on observational strategy. For integral-field spectroscopy, where the field of view is limited, the standard technique is to observe blank sky frames at regular intervals. However, even this does not usually provide sufficient compensation if individual exposure times are longer than 2-3min due to (1) changes in the absolute flux of the OH lines, (2) variations in flux among the individual OH lines and (3) effects of instrumental flexure which can lead to `P-Cygni' type residuals. The data processing method presented here takes all of these effects into account and serendipitously also improves background subtraction between the OH lines. It allows one, in principle, to use sky frames taken hours or days previously so that observations can be performed in a quasi-stare mode. As a result, the observing efficiency (i.e. fraction of time spent on a source) at the telescope can be dramatically increased.  Makes use of observations at the European Southern Observatory VLT (074.A-9011 and 075.B-0040).  E-mail: davies@mpe.mpg.de},

	Abstract = {Context. Airglow emission lines, which dominate the optical-to-near-infrared sky radiation, show strong, line-dependent variability on time scales from minutes to decades. Therefore, the subtraction of the sky background in the affected wavelength regime becomes a problem if plain-sky spectra have to be taken at a different time from the astronomical data.  Aims: A solution of this problem is the physically motivated scaling of the airglow lines in the plain-sky data to fit the sky lines in the object spectrum. We have developed a corresponding instrument-independent approach based on one-dimensional spectra.  Methods: Our code skycorr separates sky lines and sky/object continuum by an iterative approach involving a line finder and airglow line data. The sky lines, which mainly belong to OH and O2 bands, are grouped according to their expected variability. The line groups in the sky data are then scaled to fit the sky in the science data. Required pixel-specific weights for overlapping groups are taken from a comprehensive airglow model. Deviations in the wavelength calibration are corrected for by fitting Chebyshev polynomials and rebinning via asymmetric damped sinc kernels. The scaled sky lines and the sky continuum are subtracted separately.  Results: ESO-VLT X-shooter data covering 2.5 h with a good time resolution were selected to illustrate the performance. Data taken six nights and about one year before were also used as reference sky data. The variation of the sky-subtraction quality as a function of time difference between the object and sky data depends on changes in the airglow intensity, atmospheric transparency, and instrument calibration. Except for short time intervals of a few minutes, the sky line residuals were between 2.1 and 5.5 times weaker than for sky subtraction without fitting. Additional tests showed that skycorr performs consistently better than the method of Davies (2007, MNRAS, 375, 1099) developed for ESO-VLT SINFONI data.},

	Abstract = {We present an overview of the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph which was recently commissioned on the Keck II Telescope. OSIRIS works with the Keck Adaptive Optics system and utilizes an infrared transmissive lenslet array to sample a rectangular field of view at close to the Keck diffraction limit. By packing the spectra close together (2 pixel rows per spectrum) and using the Rockwell Hawaii-2 detector (wavelengths between 1 and 2.5 microns), we achieve a relatively large field of view (up to 6."4) while maintaining full broad-band spectral coverage at a resolution of 3800. Among the challenges of the instrument are: a fully cryogenic design (approximately 250 kg are brought down to 55K); four spatial scales from 0."02 to 0."10; extremely low wavefront error (approximately 25 nm of non-common path error); large all aluminum optics for the spectrograph; extremely repeatable spectral formats; and a sophisticated data reduction pipeline. OSIRIS also serves as a starting point for our design of IRIS which is a planned integral field spectrograph for the Thirty Meter Telescope.},

	Abstract = {In this second installment of the series, we look at the internal kinematics of the multiple stellar populations of the globular cluster omega Centauri in one of the parallel Hubble Space Telescope (HST) fields, located at about 3.5 half-light radii from the center of the cluster. Thanks to the over 15 yr long baseline and the exquisite astrometric precision of the HST cameras, well-measured stars in our proper-motion catalog have errors as low as ~10 muas yr-1, and the catalog itself extends to near the hydrogen-burning limit of the cluster. We show that second-generation (2G) stars are significantly more radially anisotropic than first-generation (1G) stars. The latter are instead consistent with an isotropic velocity distribution. In addition, 1G stars have excess systemic rotation in the plane of the sky with respect to 2G stars. We show that the six populations below the main-sequence (MS) knee identified in our first paper are associated with the five main population groups recently isolated on the upper MS in the core of cluster. Furthermore, we find both 1G and 2G stars in the field to be far from being in energy equipartition, with {eta }1{{G}}=-0.007+/- 0.026 for the former and {eta }2{{G}}=0.074+/- 0.029 for the latter, where eta is defined so that the velocity dispersion {sigma }mu  scales with stellar mass as {sigma }mu \propto {m}-eta . The kinematical differences reported here can help constrain the formation mechanisms for the multiple stellar populations in omega Centauri and other globular clusters. We make our astro-photometric catalog publicly available.},

	Abstract = {We present the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST), a probabilistic approach to modeling the dust extinguished photometric spectral energy distribution of an individual star while accounting for observational uncertainties common to large resolved star surveys. Given a set of photometric measurements and an observational uncertainty model, the BEAST infers the physical properties of the stellar source using stellar evolution and atmosphere models and constrains the line of sight extinction using a newly developed mixture model that encompasses the full range of dust extinction curves seen in the Local Group. The BEAST is specifically formulated for use with large multi-band surveys of resolved stellar populations. Our approach accounts for measurement uncertainties and any covariance between them due to stellar crowding (both systematic biases and uncertainties in the bias) and absolute flux calibration, thereby incorporating the full information content of the measurement. We illustrate the accuracy and precision possible with the BEAST using data from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury. While the BEAST has been developed for this survey, it can be easily applied to similar existing and planned resolved star surveys.

	Abstract = {Aims: We investigate the stellar and wind properties of a sample of late-type O dwarfs. Previous analyses of such stars have found very low mass-loss rates; rates much lower than predicted by theory (the weak wind problem).  Methods: Far-UV to optical spectra of five Galactic O stars were analyzed: HD 216898 (O9IV/O8.5V), HD 326329 (O9V), HD 66788 (O8V/O9V), zeta Oph (O9.5Vnn), and HD 216532 (O8.5V((n))). We used a grid of TLUSTY models to obtain effective temperatures, gravities, rotational velocities, and to identify wind lines. Wind parameters for each object were obtained using expanding atmosphere models calculated with the CMFGEN code.  Results: The spectra of our sample have primarily a photospheric origin. A weak wind signature is seen in C iv lambdalambda1548, 1551, from which mass-loss rates consistent with previous CMFGEN results for O8-O9V stars were derived (˜10-10-10-9 M_&sun; yr-1). A discrepancy of roughly two orders of magnitude is found between these mass-loss rates and the values predicted by theory (dot{M}_Vink), confirming a breakdown or a steepening of the modified wind momentum-luminosity relation at log L_star/L_&sun; ⪅ 5.2. We have estimated the carbon abundance for the stars of our sample and concluded that its value cannot be reduced to sufficiently small values to solve the weak wind problem. Upper limits on dot{M} were established for all objects using lines of different ions: P v lambdalambda1118, 1128, C iii lambda 1176, N v lambdalambda1239, 1243, Si iv lambdalambda1394, 1403, and N iv lambda1718. All the values obtained are in disagreement with theoretical predictions, bringing support to the reality of weak winds. Together with C iv lambdalambda1548, 1551, the use of N v lambdalambda1239, 1243 results in the lowest mass-loss rates: the upper limits indicate that dot{M} must be less than about -1.0 dex dot{M}_Vink. Upper mass-loss rate limits obtained for other transitions are also low: they indicate that dot{M} must be less than about (-0.5 $\pm$ 0.2) dex dot{M}_Vink. We studied the behavior of the Halpha line with different mass-loss rates. For two stars, only models with very low dot{M}'s provide the best fit to the UV and optical spectra. We also explored ways to fit the observed spectra with the theoretical mass-loss rates. By using large amounts of X-rays, we could reduce the predicted wind emission to the observed levels. However, unrealistic X-ray luminosities had to be used (log L_X/L_Bol ⪆ -3.5). The validity of the models used in our analyses is discussed.

@article{Fang:2017zn,
	Abstract = {Past estimates for the age of the Upper Sco Association are typically 11-13 Myr for intermediate-mass stars and 4-5 Myr for low-mass stars. In this study, we simulate populations of young stars to investigate whether this apparent dependence of estimated age on spectral type may be explained by the star formation history of the association. Solar and intermediate mass stars begin their pre-main sequence evolution on the Hayashi track, with fully convective interiors and cool photospheres. Intermediate-mass stars quickly heat up and transition onto the radiative Henyey track. As a consequence, for clusters in which star formation occurs on a timescale similar to that of the transition from a convective to a radiative interior, discrepancies in ages will arise when ages are calculated as a function of temperature instead of mass. Simple simulations of a cluster with constant star formation over several Myr may explain about half of the difference in inferred ages versus photospheric temperature; speculative constructions that consist of a constant star formation followed by a large supernova-driven burst could fully explain the differences, including those between F and G stars where evolutionary tracks may be more accurate. The age spreads of low-mass stars predicted from these prescriptions for star formation are consistent with the observed luminosity spread of Upper Sco. The conclusion that a lengthy star formation history will yield a temperature dependence in ages is expected from the basic physics of pre-main sequence evolution, and is qualitatively robust to the large uncertainties in pre-main sequence evolutionary models.},

	Abstract = {Our understanding of the brown dwarf population in star forming regions is dependent on knowing distances and proper motions, and therefore will be improved through the Gaia space mission. In this paper, we select new samples of very low mass objects (VLMOs) in Upper Scorpius using UKIDSS colors and optimised proper motions calculated using Gaia DR1. The scatter in proper motions from VLMOs in Upper Scorpius is now (for the first time) dominated by the kinematic spread of the region itself, not by the positional uncertainties. With age and mass estimates updated using Gaia parallaxes for early type stars in the same region, we determine masses for all VLMOs. Our final most complete sample includes 453 VLMOs of which $\sim$125 are expected to be brown dwarfs. The cleanest sample is comprised of 131 VLMOs, with $\sim$105 brown dwarfs. We also compile a joint sample from the literature which includes 415 VLMOs, out of which 152 are likely brown dwarfs. The disc fraction among low-mass brown dwarfs ($M<0.05 M_{\odot}$) is substantially higher than in more massive objects, indicating that discs around low-mass brown dwarfs survive longer than in low-mass stars overall. The mass function for $0.01<M<0.1$ $M_{\odot}$ is consistent with the Kroupa IMF. We investigate the possibility that some 'proper motion outliers' have undergone a dynamical ejection early in their evolution. Our analysis shows that the color-magnitude cuts used when selecting samples introduce strong bias into the population statistics due to varying level of contamination and completeness.},

	Abstract = {We present deep near-infrared HST/WFC3 observations of the young supermassive Galactic star cluster Westerlund 1 and an adjacent control field. The depth of the data is sufficient to derive the mass function for the cluster as a function of radius down to 0.15 M&sun; in the outer parts of the cluster. We identify for the first time a flattening in the mass function (in logarithmic units) at a mass range that is consistent with that of the field and nearby embedded clusters. Through log-normal functional fits to the mass functions we find the nominal peak mass to be comparable to that of the field and nearby embedded star clusters. The width of a log-normal fit appears slightly narrow compared to the width of the field initial mass function, closer to the values found for globular clusters. The subsolar content within the cluster does not appear to be mass segregated in contrast to the findings for the supersolar content. The total mass of Westerlund 1 is estimated to be 44-57 × 103M&sun; where the main uncertainty is the choice of the isochrone age and the higher mass slope. Comparing the photometric mass with the dynamically determined mass, Westerlund 1 is sufficiently massive to remain bound and could potentially evolve into a lowmass globular cluster.

The observational goals are to construct catalogs of star-forming complex stellar members with well-defined criteria and maps of nebular gas (particularly of hot X-ray-emitting plasma) and dust. A catalog of MYStIX Probable Complex Members with several hundred OB stars and 31,784 low-mass pre-main sequence stars is assembled. This sample and related data products will be used to seek new empirical constraints on theoretical models of cluster formation and dynamics, mass segregation, OB star formation, star formation triggering on the periphery of H II regions, and the survivability of protoplanetary disks in H II regions. This paper gives an introduction and overview of the project, covering the data analysis methodology and application to two star-forming regions: NGC 2264 and the Trifid Nebula.},

	Abstract = {The Massive Young Star-Forming Complex Study in Infrared and X-rays (MYStIX) project provides a comparative study of 20 Galactic massive star-forming complexes (d = 0.4-3.6 kpc). Probable stellar members in each target complex are identified using X-ray and/or infrared data via two pathways: (1) X-ray detections of young/massive stars with coronal activity/strong winds or (2) infrared excess (IRE) selection of young stellar objects (YSOs) with circumstellar disks and/or protostellar envelopes. We present the methodology for the second pathway using Spitzer/IRAC, 2MASS, and UKIRT imaging and photometry. Although IRE selection of YSOs is well-trodden territory, MYStIX presents unique challenges. The target complexes range from relatively nearby clouds in uncrowded fields located toward the outer Galaxy (e.g., NGC 2264, the Flame Nebula) to more distant, massive complexes situated along complicated, inner Galaxy sightlines (e.g., NGC 6357, M17). We combine IR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with IR color cuts and spatial clustering analysis to identify IRE sources and isolate probable YSO members in each MYStIX target field from the myriad types of contaminating sources that can resemble YSOs: extragalactic sources, evolved stars, nebular knots, and even unassociated foreground/background YSOs. Applying our methodology consistently across 18 of the target complexes, we produce the MYStIX IRE Source (MIRES) Catalog comprising 20,719 sources, including 8686 probable stellar members of the MYStIX target complexes. We also classify the SEDs of 9365 IR counterparts to MYStIX X-ray sources to assist the first pathway, the identification of X-ray-detected stellar members. The MIRES Catalog provides a foundation for follow-up studies of diverse phenomena related to massive star cluster formation, including protostellar outflows, circumstellar disks, and sequential star formation triggered by massive star feedback processes.},

	Abstract = {We present self-consistent calculations coupling numerical hydrodynamics simulations of collapsing pre-stellar cores and stellar evolution models of accreting objects. We analyse the main impact of consistent accretion history on the evolution and lithium depletion of young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. These consistent models confirm the generation of a luminosity spread in Herzsprung-Russell diagrams at ages  1-10 Myr. They also confirm that early accretion can produce objects with abnormal Li depletion, as found in a previous study that was based on arbitrary accretion rates. The results strengthen that objects with anomalously high level of Li depletion in young clusters should be extremely rare. We also find that early phases of burst accretion can produce coeval models of similar mass with a range of different Li surface abundances, and in particular with Li-excess compared to the predictions of non-accreting counterparts. This result is due to a subtle competition between the effect of burst accretion and its impact on the central stellar temperature, the growth of the stellar radiative core and the accretion of fresh Li from the accretion disk. Only consistent models could reveal such a subtle combination of effects. This new result could explain the recent, puzzling observations of Li-excess of fast rotators in the young cluster NGC 2264. Present self-consistent accreting models are available in electronic form.},

	Abstract = {The Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a compact high-resolution near-infrared cross-dispersed spectrograph whose primary disperser is a silicon immersion grating. IGRINS covers the entire portion of the wavelength range between 1.45 and 2.45mum that is accessible from the ground and does so in a single exposure with a resolving power of 40,000. Individual volume phase holographic (VPH) gratings serve as cross-dispersing elements for separate spectrograph arms covering the H and K bands. On the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith telescope at the McDonald Observatory, the slit size is 1ʺ x 15ʺ and the plate scale is 0.27ʺ pixel. The spectrograph employs two 2048 x 2048 pixel Teledyne Scientific and Imaging HAWAII-2RG detectors with SIDECAR ASIC cryogenic controllers. The instrument includes four subsystems; a calibration unit, an input relay optics module, a slit-viewing camera, and nearly identical H and K spectrograph modules. The use of a silicon immersion grating and a compact white pupil design allows the spectrograph collimated beam size to be only 25mm, which permits a moderately sized (0.96m x 0.6m x 0.38m) rectangular cryostat to contain the entire spectrograph. The fabrication and assembly of the optical and mechanical components were completed in 2013. We describe the major design characteristics of the instrument including the system requirements and the technical strategy to meet them. We also present early performance test results obtained from the commissioning runs at the McDonald Observatory.},

	Abstract = {Accretion through circumstellar disks plays an important role in star formation and in establishing the properties of the regions in which planets form and migrate. The mechanisms by which protostellar and protoplanetary disks accrete onto low-mass stars are not clear; angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is thought to be involved, but the low-ionization conditions in major regions of protoplanetary disks lead to a variety of complex nonideal magnetohydrodynamic effects whose implications are not fully understood. Accretion in pre-main-sequence stars of masses ≲1M&sun; (and in at least some 2-3-M&sun; systems) is generally funneled by the stellar magnetic field, which disrupts the disk at scales typically of order a few stellar radii. Matter moving at near free-fall velocities shocks at the stellar surface; the resulting accretion luminosities from the dissipation of kinetic energy indicate that mass addition during the T Tauri phase over the typical disk lifetime ˜3 Myr is modest in terms of stellar evolution, but is comparable to total disk reservoirs as estimated from millimeter-wave dust emission (˜10-2 M&sun;). Pre-main-sequence accretion is not steady, encompassing timescales ranging from approximately hours to a century, with longer-timescale variations tending to be the largest. Accretion during the protostellar phase---while the protostellar envelope is still falling onto the disk---is much less well understood, mostly because the properties of the central obscured protostar are difficult to estimate. Kinematic measurements of protostellar masses with new interfometric facilities should improve estimates of accretion rates during the earliest phases of star formation.},

	Abstract = {We present new VLT/X-Shooter optical and near-infrared spectra of a sample of 17 candidate young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs located in the rho-Ophiucus cluster. We derived the spectral type and extinction for all the targets, and then we determined their physical parameters. All the objects but one have M*≲0.6 M&sun;, and eight have mass below or close to the hydrogen-burning limit. Using the intensity of various permitted emission lines present in their spectra, we determined the accretion luminosity and mass accretion rates (Macc) for all the objects. When compared with previous works targeting the same sample, we find that, in general, these objects are not as strongly accreting as previously reported, and we suggest that the reason is our more accurate estimate of the photospheric parameters. We also compare our findings with recent works in other slightly older star-forming regions, such as Lupus, to investigate possible differences in the accretion properties, but we find that the accretion properties for our targets have the same dependence on the stellar and substellar parameters as in the other regions. This leads us to conclude that we do not find evidence for a different dependence of Macc with M* when comparing low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Moreover, we find a similar small (≲1 dex) scatter in the Macc-M* relation as in some of our recent works in other star-forming regions, and no significant differences in Macc due to different ages or properties of the regions. The latter result suffers, however, from low statistics and sample selection biases in the current studies. The small scatter in the Macc-M* correlation confirms that mass accretion rate measurements in the literature based on uncertain photospheric parameters and single accretion indicators, such as the Halpha width, can lead to a scatter that is unphysically large. Our studies show that only broadband spectroscopic surveys coupled with a detailed analysis of the photospheric and accretion properties allows us to properly study the evolution of disk accretion rates in star-forming regions.  This work is based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under programme ID 085.C-0876.Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {Aims.The aim of this paper is to provide a measurement of the mass accretion rate in a large, complete sample of objects in the core of the star forming region rho Oph. Methods: .The sample includes most of the objects (104 out of 111) with evidence of a circumstellar disk from mid-infrared photometry; it covers a stellar mass range from about 0.03 to 3 M_&sun; and it is complete to a limiting mass of  0.05 M_&sun;. We used J and K-band spectra to derive the mass accretion rate of each object from the intensity of the hydrogen recombination lines, Pabeta or Brgamma. For comparison, we also obtained similar spectra of 35 diskless objects. Results: .The results show that emission in these lines is only seen in stars with disks, and can be used as an indicator of accretion. However, the converse does not hold, as about 50% of our disk objects do not have detectable line emission. The measured accretion rates show a strong correlation with the mass of the central object (dot M_acc ∝ M_star1.8$\pm$0.2) and a large spread, of two orders of magnitude at least, for any interval of M_star. A comparison with existing data for Taurus shows that the objects in the two regions have similar behaviour, at least for objects more massive than ˜ 0.1 M_&sun;. The implications of these results are briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present optical spectra of pre-main-sequence (PMS) candidates around the Halpha region taken with the Southern African Large Telescope in the low metallicity (Z) Galactic region Sh 2-284, which includes the open cluster Dolidze 25 with an atypical low metallicity of Z ~ 1/5 Z &sun;. It has been suggested on the basis of both theory and observations that PMS mass-accretion rates, \dot{M}acc, are a function of Z. We present the first sample of spectroscopic estimates of mass-accretion rates for PMS stars in any low-Z star-forming region. Our data set was enlarged with literature data of Halpha emission in intermediate-resolution R-band spectroscopy. Our total sample includes 24 objects spanning a mass range between 1 and 2 M &sun; and with a median age of approximately 3.5 Myr. The vast majority (21 out of 24) show evidence for a circumstellar disk on the basis of Two Micron All Sky Survey and Spitzer infrared photometry. We find \dot{M}acc in the 1-2 M &sun; interval to depend quasi-quadratically on stellar mass, with \dot{M}acc vprop M\ast 2.4 +/-  0.35, and inversely with stellar age, with \dot{M}acc vprop t\ast - 0.7 +/-  0.4. Furthermore, we compare our spectroscopic \dot{M}acc measurements with solar Z Galactic PMS stars in the same mass range, but, surprisingly find no evidence for a systematic change in \dot{M}acc with Z. We show that literature accretion-rate studies are influenced by detection limits, and we suggest that \dot{M}acc may be controlled by factors other than Z *, M *, and age.},

	Abstract = {We present near-infrared multi-object spectroscopy and JHK s imaging of the massive stellar content of the Galactic star-forming region W3 Main, obtained with LUCI at the Large Binocular Telescope. We confirm 15 OB stars in W3 Main and derive spectral types between O5V and B4V from their absorption line spectra. Three massive young stellar objects are identified by their emission line spectra and near-infrared excess. The color-color diagram of the detected sources allows a detailed investigation of the slope of the near-infrared extinction law toward W3 Main. Analysis of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram suggests that the Nishiyama extinction law fits the stellar population of W3 Main best (E(J - H)/E(H - K s) = 1.76 and R_{{K_s}} = 1.44). From our spectrophotometric analysis of the massive stars and the nature of their surrounding H II regions, we derive the evolutionary sequence of W3 Main and we find evidence of an age spread of at least 2-3 Myr. While the most massive star (IRS2) is already evolved, indications for high-mass pre-main-sequence evolution are found for another star (IRS N1), deeply embedded in an ultracompact H II (UCH II) region, in line with the different evolutionary phases observed in the corresponding H II regions. We derive a stellar mass of W3 Main of (4 $\pm$ 1) × 103 M &sun; by extrapolating from the number of OB stars using a Kroupa initial mass function and correcting for our spectroscopic incompleteness. We have detected the photospheres of OB stars from the more evolved diffuse H II region to the much younger UCH II regions, suggesting that these stars have finished their formation and cleared away their circumstellar disks very fast. Only in the hyper-compact H II region (IRS5) do the early-type stars seem to be still surrounded by circumstellar material.  Based on data acquired using the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT).

	Abstract = {Aims: An important question about Be stars is whether they are born as such or whether they have become Be stars during their evolution. It is necessary to observe young clusters to answer this question.  Methods: To this end, observations of stars in NGC 6611 and the star-formation region of Eagle Nebula were carried out with the ESO-WFI in slitless spectroscopic mode and at the VLT-GIRAFFE (R ~= 6400-17 000). The targets for the GIRAFFE observations were pre-selected from the literature and our catalogue of emission-line stars based on the WFI study. GIRAFFE observations allowed us to study the population of the early-type stars accurately both with and without emission lines. For this study, we determined the fundamental parameters of OBA stars thanks to the GIRFIT code. We also studied the status of the objects (main sequence or pre-main sequence stars) by using IR data, membership probabilities, and location in HR diagrams.  Results: The nature of the early-type stars with emission-line stars in NGC 6611 and its surrounding environment is derived. The slitless observations with the WFI clearly indicate a small number of emission-line stars in M16. We observed with GIRAFFE 101 OBA stars, among them 9 are emission-line stars with circumstellar emission in Halpha. We found that W080 could be a new He-strong star, like W601. W301 is a possible classical Be star, W503 is a mass-transfer eclipsing binary with an accretion disk, and the other ones are possible Herbig Ae/Be stars. We also found that the rotational velocities of main sequence B stars are 18% lower than those of pre-main sequence B stars, in good agreement with theory about the evolution of rotational velocities. Combining adaptive optics, IR data, spectroscopy, and radial velocity indications, we found that 27% of the B-type stars are binaries. We also redetermined the age of NGC 6611 found equal to 1.2-1.8 Myears, in good agreement with the most recent determinations.},

	Abstract = {Formation of massive stars by accretion requires a high accretion rate of \dot{M}_* > 10^{-4} M_{&sun;} yr^{-1} to overcome the radiation pressure barrier of the forming stars. Here, we study evolution of protostars accreting at such high rates by solving the structure of the central star and the inner accreting envelope simultaneously. The protostellar evolution is followed starting from small initial cores until their arrival at the stage of the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) stars. An emphasis is put on evolutionary features different from those with a low accretion rate of \dot{M}_* ˜ 10^{-5} M_{&sun;} yr^{-1}, which is presumed in the standard scenario for low-mass star formation. With the high accretion rate of \dot{M}_* ˜ 10^{-3} M_{&sun;} yr^{-1}, the protostellar radius becomes very large and exceeds 100 R sun. Unlike the cases of low accretion rates, deuterium burning hardly affects the evolution, and the protostar remains radiative even after its ignition. It is not until the stellar mass reaches sime40 M sun that hydrogen burning begins and the protostar reaches the ZAMS phase, and this ZAMS arrival mass increases with the accretion rate. These features are similar to those of the first star formation in the universe, where high accretion rates are also expected, rather than to the present-day low-mass star formation. At a very high accretion rate of >3 × 10-3 M sun yr-1, the total luminosity of the protostar becomes so high that the resultant radiation pressure inhibits the growth of the protostars under steady accretion before reaching the ZAMS stage. Therefore, the evolution under the critical accretion rate 3 × 10-3 M sun yr-1 gives the upper mass limit of possible pre-main sequence stars at sime60 M sun. The upper mass limit of MS stars is also set by the radiation pressure onto the dusty envelope under the same accretion rate at sime250 M sun. We also propose that the central source enshrouded in the Orion KL/BN nebula has effective temperature and luminosity consistent with our model and is a possible candidate for such protostars growing under the high accretion rate.},

	Abstract = {The formation process of massive stars is still poorly understood. Massive young stellar objects (mYSOs) are deeply embedded in their parental clouds; these objects are rare, and thus typically distant, and their reddened spectra usually preclude the determination of their photospheric parameters. M17 is one of the best-studied H ii regions in the sky, is relatively nearby, and hosts a young stellar population. We have obtained optical to near-infrared spectra of previously identified candidate mYSOs and a few OB stars in this region with X-shooter on the ESO Very Large Telescope. The large wavelength coverage enables a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the photospheres and circumstellar disks of these candidate mYSOs. We confirm the pre-main-sequence (PMS) nature of six of the stars and characterise the O stars. The PMS stars have radii that are consistent with being contracting towards the main sequence and are surrounded by a remnant accretion disk. The observed infrared excess and the double-peaked emission lines provide an opportunity to measure structured velocity profiles in the disks. We compare the observed properties of this unique sample of young massive stars with evolutionary tracks of massive protostars and propose that these mYSOs near the western edge of the H ii region are on their way to become main-sequence stars ( 6-20 M&sun;) after having undergone high mass accretion rates (Macc   10-4-10-3M&sun;yr-1). Their spin distribution upon arrival at the zero age main-sequence is consistent with that observed for young B stars, assuming conservation of angular momentum and homologous contraction.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory at Paranal, Chile (ESO programmes 60.A-9404(A), 085.D-0741, 089.C-0874(A), and 091.C-0934(B)).The full normalised X-shooter spectra are available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (http://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/604/A78},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution (R~=18,000), high signal-to-noise ratio, 2 mum spectra of 52 IR-selected Class I and flat-spectrum young stellar objects in the Taurus-Auriga, rho Ophiuchi, Serpens, Perseus, and Corona Australis dark clouds. We detect key absorption lines in 41 objects and fit synthetic spectra generated from pre-main-sequence models to deduce the effective temperatures, surface gravities, near-IR veilings, rotation velocities, and radial velocities of each of these 41 sources. We find these objects to span ranges in effective temperature, surface gravity, and stellar luminosity that appear similar to those of late spectral type Class II sources and classical T Tauri stars. However, because of significant but uncertain corrections for scattering and extinction, the derived luminosities for the embedded protostellar objects must be regarded as being highly uncertain. We determine that the mean 2 mum veiling of Class I and flat-spectrum objects is significantly higher than that of Class II objects in the same region where both types of objects are extensively observed (rho Oph). We find that a significant fraction of our protostellar sample also exhibits emission lines. Twenty-three objects show H2 emission, which is usually indicative of the presence of energetic outflows. Thirty-four sources show H I Brgamma emission, and a number of these exhibit profile asymmetries consistent with infall. Eight sources show significant Deltav=2 CO emission suggestive of emission from a circumstellar disk. Overall, these observations indicate that Class I and flat-spectrum objects are self-embedded protostars undergoing significant mass accretion, although the objects appear to span a broad range of mass accretion activity.  Data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory from telescope time allocated to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration through the agency's scientific partnership with the California Institute of Technology and the University of California. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

@article{Gullikson:2016tn,
	Abstract = {Young, intermediate-mass stars are experiencing renewed interest as targets for direct-imaging planet searches. However, these types of stars are part of multiple systems more often than not. Close stellar companions affect the formation and orbital architecture of planetary systems, and the properties of the companions can help constrain the binary formation mechanism. Unfortunately, close companions are difficult and expensive to detect with imaging techniques. In this paper, we describe the direct spectral detection method wherein a high-resolution spectrum of the primary is cross-correlated against a template for a companion star. Variants of this method have previously been used to search for stellar, brown dwarf, and even planetary companions. We show that the direct spectral detection method can detect companions as late as M-type orbiting A0 or earlier primary stars in a single epoch on small-aperture telescopes. In addition to estimating the detection limits, we determine the sources of uncertainty in characterizing the companion temperature, and find that large systematic biases can exist. After calibrating the systematic biases with synthetic binary star observations, we apply the method to a sample of 34 known binary systems with an A- or B-type primary star. We detect nine total companions, including four of the five known companions with literature temperatures between 4000 K \lt  T\lt 6000 {{K}}, the temperature range for which our method is optimized. We additionally characterize the companion for the first time in two previously single-lined binary systems and one binary identified with speckle interferometry. This method provides an inexpensive way to use small-aperture telescopes to detect binary companions with moderate mass ratios, and is competitive with high-resolution imaging techniques inside ˜100-200 mas.},

	Abstract = {We present a deep Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) survey of the OB association IC 1795 carried out to investigate the evolution of protoplanetary disks in regions of massive star formation. Combining Spitzer/IRAC data with Chandra/Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer observations, we find 289 cluster members. An additional 340 sources with an infrared excess, but without X-ray counterpart, are classified as cluster member candidates. Both surveys are complete down to stellar masses of about 1 M sun. We present pre-main-sequence isochrones computed for the first time in the Spitzer/IRAC colors. The age of the cluster, determined via the location of the Class III sources in the [3.6]-[4.5]/[3.6] color-magnitude diagram, is in the range of 3-5 Myr. As theoretically expected, we do not find any systematic variation in the spatial distribution of disks within 0.6 pc of either O-type star in the association. However, the disk fraction in IC 1795 does depend on the stellar mass: sources with masses >2 M sun have a disk fraction of ~20%, while lower mass objects (2-0.8 M sun) have a disk fraction of ~50%. This implies that disks around massive stars have a shorter dissipation timescale.},

	Abstract = {It is generally believed that expanding superbubbles and mechanical feedback from massive stars trigger star formation, because there are numerous examples of superbubbles showing secondary star formation at their edges. However, although these systems show an age sequence, they do not provide strong evidence of a causal relationship. The W3/W4 Galactic star-forming complex suggests a three-generation hierarchy: the supergiant shell structures correspond to the oldest generation; these triggered the formation of IC 1795 in W3, the progenitor of a molecular superbubble that in turn triggered the current star-forming episodes in the embedded regions W3-North, W3-Main, and W3-OH. We present UBV photometry and spectroscopic classifications for IC 1795, which show an age of 3-5 Myr. This age is intermediate between the reported 6-20 Myr age of the supergiant shell system and the extremely young ages (104-105 yr) for the embedded knots of the ultracompact H II regions, W3-North, W3-Main, and W3-OH. Thus, an age sequence is indeed confirmed for the entire W3/W4 hierarchical system. This therefore provides some of the first convincing evidence that superbubble action and mechanical feedback are indeed a triggering mechanism for star formation.},

	Abstract = {M17 is one of the youngest and most massive nearby star-formation regions in the Galaxy. It features a bright H II region erupting as a blister from the side of a giant molecular cloud (GMC). Combining photometry from the Spitzer Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) with complementary infrared (IR) surveys, we identify candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) throughout a 1fdg5 × 1$\,^{\circ}$ field that includes the M17 complex. The long sightline through the Galaxy behind M17 creates significant contamination in our YSO sample from unassociated sources with similar IR colors. Removing contaminants, we produce a highly reliable catalog of 96 candidate YSOs with a high probability of association with the M17 complex. We fit model spectral energy distributions to these sources and constrain their physical properties. Extrapolating the mass function of 62 intermediate-mass YSOs (M sstarf > 3 M sun), we estimate that >1000 stars are in the process of forming in the extended outer regions of M17. The remaining 34 candidate YSOs are found in a 0.17 deg2 field containing the well-studied M17 H II region and photodissociation region (PDR), where bright diffuse mid-IR emission drastically reduces the sensitivity of the GLIMPSE point-source detections. By inspecting IR survey images from IRAS and GLIMPSE, we find that M17 lies on the rim of a large shell structure ~0fdg5 in diameter (~20 pc at 2.1 kpc). We present maps of 12CO and 13CO (J = 2 --> 1) emission observed with the Heinrich Hertz Telescope. The CO emission shows that the shell is a coherent, kinematic structure associated with M17, centered at v = 19 km s-1. The shell is an extended bubble outlining the PDR of a faint, diffuse H II region several Myr old. We identify a group of candidate ionizing stars within the bubble. YSOs in our catalog are concentrated around the bubble rim, providing evidence that massive star formation has been triggered by the expansion of the bubble. The formation of the massive cluster ionizing the M17 H II region itself may have been similarly triggered. We conclude that the star formation history in the extended environment of M17 has been punctuated by successive waves of massive star formation propagating through a GMC complex.},

The survey is designed to reach past the main-sequence turn-off at the distance of the Galactic center through a reddening E(B-V) of 1.5 mag. Typical single-exposure depths are 23.7, 22.8, 22.3, 21.9, and 21.0 mag in the grizY bands, with seeing around 1 arcsecond. The footprint covers the Galactic plane with |b| < 4 degrees, 5 degrees > l > -120 degrees. The survey pipeline simultaneously solves for the positions and fluxes of tens of thousands of sources in each image, delivering positions and fluxes of roughly two billion stars with better than 10 mmag precision. Most of these objects are highly reddened and deep in the Galactic disk, probing the structure and properties of the Milky Way and its interstellar medium. The full survey is publicly available.},

	Abstract = {This is the third installment of the Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS), a massive spectroscopic survey of Galactic O stars, based on new homogeneous, high signal-to-noise ratio, R ˜ 2500 digital observations selected from the Galactic O-Star Catalog. In this paper, we present 142 additional stellar systems with O stars from both hemispheres, bringing the total of O-type systems published within the project to 590. Among the new objects, there are 20 new O stars. We also identify 11 new double-lined spectroscopic binaries, 6 of which are of O+O type and 5 of O+B type, and an additional new tripled-lined spectroscopic binary of O+O+B type. We also revise some of the previous GOSSS classifications, present some egregious examples of stars erroneously classified as O-type in the past, introduce the use of luminosity class IV at spectral types O4-O5.5, and adapt the classification scheme to the work of Arias et al.  The GOSSS spectroscopic data in this article were gathered with five facilities: the 1.5 m Telescope at the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (OSN), the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory (LCO), the 3.5 m Telescope at Calar Alto Observatory (CAHA), and the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) and 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) at Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos (ORM).},

	Abstract = {Context. Embedded clusters like W3 Main are complex and dynamically evolving systems that represent an important phase in the star formation process.  Aims: We aim to characterize of the entire stellar content of W3 Main in a statistical sense, which will then identify possible differences in the evolutionary phase of the stellar populations and find clues about the formation mechanism of this massive embedded cluster.  Methods: Deep JHKs imaging is used to derive the disk fraction, Ks-band luminosity functions, and mass functions for several subregions in W3 Main. A two-dimensional completeness analysis using artificial star experiments is applied as a crucial ingredient for assessing realistic completeness limits for our photometry.  Results: We find an overall disk fraction of 7.7 $\pm$ 2.3%, radially varying from 9.4 $\pm$ 3.0% in the central 1 pc to 5.6 $\pm$ 2.2% in the outer parts of W3 Main. The mass functions derived for three subregions are consistent with a Kroupa and Chabrier mass function. The mass function of IRSN3 is complete down to 0.14 M&sun; and shows a break at M ~ 0.5 M&sun;.  Conclusions: We interpret the higher disk fraction in the center as evidence that the cluster center is younger. We find that the evolutionary sequence observed in the low-mass stellar population is consistent with the observed age spread among the massive stars. An analysis of the mass function variations does not show evidence of mass segregation. W3 Main is currently still actively forming stars, showing that the ionizing feedback of OB stars is confined to small areas (~0.5 pc). The FUV feedback might be influencing large regions of the cluster as suggested by the low overall disk fraction.  Based on data acquired using the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT).

	Abstract = {Attention is given to a population of 110 stars in the NGC 6611 cluster of the Eagle nebula that have prominent near-infrared excess and optical colours typical of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars older than 8 Myr. At least half of those for which spectroscopy exists have a Halpha emission line profile revealing active accretion. In principle, the V - I colours of all these stars would be consistent with those of young PMS objects (<1 Myr) whose radiation is heavily obscured by a circumstellar disc seen at high inclination and in small part scattered towards the observer by the back side of the disc. However, using theoretical models it is shown here that objects of this type can only account for a few per cent of this population. In fact, the spatial distribution of these objects, their X-ray luminosities, their optical brightness, their positions in the colour-magnitude diagram and the weak Li absorption lines of the stars studied spectroscopically suggest that most of them are at least eight times older than the ˜1 Myr-old PMS stars already known in this cluster and could be as old as ˜30 Myr. This is the largest homogeneous sample to date of Galactic PMS stars considerably older than 8 Myr that are still actively accreting from a circumstellar disc and it allows us to set a lower limit of 7 per cent to the disc frequency at ˜16 Myr in NGC 6611. These values imply a characteristic exponential lifetime of ˜6 Myr for disc dissipation.},

@article{Bonito:2013vy,
	Abstract = {Context. The young open cluster NGC 6611 includes a group of peculiar objects with interesting properties among its candidate members: blue stars with infrared (IR) excesses. These stars show excesses in IR bands, a signature of the presence of a circumstellar disk, but optical colors typical of older field stars. To confirm their membership in the cluster, it is therefore important to use new spectroscopic observations, together with previous photometric data.  Aims: We aim to confirm the membership of these objects and investigate their physical properties to verify whether the observed colors are intrinsic or altered by the disk or by the accretion processes.  Methods: We analyzed the intermediate-resolution spectroscopic data obtained for a subsample of blue stars in NGC 6611 with FLAMES. In particular, we focused on the study of 1) the profile of the Halpha emission line, to select stars with accretion and outflow activity; 2) the Li absorption line, used as a youth indicator; 3) the radial velocity.  Results: Using the spectroscopic analysis, it has been possible to investigate the Li absorption line, as well as to distinguish between stars with inert or active disks. In particular, from the analysis of the Halpha emission line we were able to infer the activity due to the accretion and outflow processes and the variability of the emission. We also investigated the binarity of the blue stars and their membership to NGC 6611.  Conclusions: From our spectroscopic analysis, we conclude that half of the sample of blue stars (10/20) are confirmed members of NGC 6611 (with 6 more stars that could also be possible members). In conclusion, our results indicate that members of young clusters can also be found in an anomalous region of the color-magnitude diagram, i.e., outside of the pre-main sequence locus where most of the cluster members lie.},

	Abstract = {The stellar content of M17 has been investigated by multicolor photometry and spectroscopy. Various independent estimates yield a distance of 2.1 +/- 0.2 kpc. The ratio of total-to-selective extinction is R = 3.9. Within a projected area of 3.6 × 3.7 pc, there are several thousand stars. About 74% of them show infrared excess suggesting the presence of dense circumstellar material; the excess frequency is higher for fainter stars. The number of spectroscopically classified exciting stars could be enlarged from 13 to 46. The two central O4 stars are both spectroscopic binaries; multiplicity of other early O-type stars could also be established, increasing the number of high-mass stars even further. Our data suggest at least two episodes of star formation: There are about 500 ZAMS sources (2 < AV < 7)---among them many spectroscopically classified OB stars and a significant fraction of lower mass sources with infrared excess (~25%) and X-ray emission (~6%). About 3350 heavily reddened sources with 10 < AV < 40) are most likely deeply embedded pre-main-sequence objects with an age of less than 5 × 105 yr. This group contains about 47% sources with infrared excess and 12% X-ray emitters. Cluster members later than about A0 have not yet reached the main sequence. In addition, a group of 647 protostellar candidates (1.5 < K - L < 6.9) has been detected in the cluster center as well as in the northern and southwestern bar. This population of accreting protostars argues in favor of ongoing star formation triggered by the central O stars in M17.

	Abstract = {We calculate radiatively driven wind models of main-sequence B stars and provide the wind mass-loss rates and terminal velocities. The main-sequence mass-loss rate strongly depends on the stellar effective temperature. For the hottest B stars the mass-loss rate amounts to 10-9 M&sun; year-1, while for the cooler ones the mass-loss rate is lower by more than three orders of magnitude. Main-sequence B stars with solar abundance and effective temperatures lower than about 15 000 K (later than spectral type B5) do not have any homogeneous line-driven wind. We predict the wind mass-loss rates for the solar chemical composition and for the modified abundance of heavier elements to study the winds of chemically peculiar stars. The mass-loss rate may either increase or decrease with increasing abundance, depending on the importance of the induced emerging flux redistribution. Stars with overabundant silicon may have homogeneous winds even below the solar abundance wind limit at 15 000 K. The winds of main-sequence B stars lie below the static limit, that is, a static atmosphere solution is also possible. This points to an important problem regarding the initiation of these winds. We discuss the implications of our models for rotational braking, filling the magnetosphere of Bp stars, and for chemically peculiar stars.},

	Abstract = {We study the stellar and wind properties of a sample of Galactic O dwarfs to track the conditions under which weak winds (i.e. mass loss rates lower than   10-8 M&sun; yr-1) appear. The sample is composed of low and high luminosity dwarfs including Vz stars and stars known to display qualitatively weak winds. Atmosphere models including non-LTE treatment, spherical expansion and line blanketing are computed with the code CMFGEN (Hillier & Miller 1998, ApJ, 496, 407). Both UV and Halpha lines are used to derive wind properties while optical H and He lines give the stellar parameters. We find that the stars of our sample are usually 1 to 4 Myr old. Mass loss rates of all stars are found to be lower than expected from the hydrodynamical predictions of Vink et al. (2001, A&A, 369, 574). For stars with log {L}/{L&sun;} ⪆ 5.2, the reduction is by less than a factor 5 and is mainly due to the inclusion of clumping in the models. For stars with log {L}/{L&sun;} ⪅ 5.2 the reduction can be as high as a factor 100. The inclusion of X-ray emission (possibly due to magnetic mechanisms) in models with low density is crucial to derive accurate mass loss rates from UV lines, while it is found to be unimportant for high density winds. The modified wind momentum   luminosity relation shows a significant change of slope around this transition luminosity. Terminal velocities of low luminosity stars are also found to be low. Both mass loss rates and terminal velocities of low L stars are consistent with a reduced line force parameter alpha. However, the physical reason for such a reduction is still not clear although the finding of weak winds in Galactic stars excludes the role of a reduced metallicity. There may be a link between an early evolutionary state and a weak wind, but this has to be confirmed by further studies of Vz stars. X-rays, through the change in the ionisation structure they imply, may be at the origin of a reduction of the radiative acceleration, leading to lower mass loss rates. A better understanding of the origin of X-rays is of crucial importance for the study of the physics of weak winds.},

	Abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy from APOGEE and wide-field optical photometry from Pan-STARRS1 have recently made precise measurements of the shape of the extinction curve possible for tens of thousands of stars, parameterized by R(V). These measurements revealed structures in R(V) with large angular scales, which are challenging to explain in existing dust paradigms. In this work, we combine three-dimensional maps of dust column density with R(V) measurements to constrain the three-dimensional distribution of R(V) in the Milky Way. We find that the variations in R(V) are correlated on kiloparsec scales. In particular, most of the dust within one kiloparsec in the outer Galaxy, including many local molecular clouds (Orion, Taurus, Perseus, California, and Cepheus), has a significantly lower R(V) than more distant dust in the Milky Way. These results provide new input to models of dust evolution and processing, and complicate the application of locally derived extinction curves to more distant regions of the Milky Way and to other galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Hydrogen and helium line spectra are crucial diagnostic features for the quantitative analysis of OB stars. Hybrid non-LTE line-formation calculations for these elements have not been discussed thoroughly so far, despite their wide use for analyses of metal line spectra. We compute synthetic spectra based on a hybrid non-LTE approach in order to test the ability of these models to reproduce high-resolution and high-S/N spectra of dwarf and giant stars and also to compare them with published grids of non-LTE (OSTAR2002) and LTE (Padova) models. Methods: Our approach solves the restricted non-LTE problem based on classical line-blanketed LTE model atmospheres. State-of-the-art model atoms and line-broadening theories are employed to model the H and He i/ii spectra over the entire optical range and in the near-IR. Results: A comparison with published line-blanketed non-LTE models validates the suitability of the LTE approximation for modelling the atmospheric structure of late O to early B-type dwarf and giant stars at metallicities down to (at least) 1/5×solar. Our hybrid non-LTE synthetic spectra simultaneously match almost all measurable hydrogen and helium lines observed in six test stars over a wide spectral range from the Balmer limit to the near-IR, except for only a few well-understood cases. A robust starting point for studies of the metal spectra is thus established. Our approach reproduces other published non-LTE calculations, but avoids inconsistencies in the modelling of the He i singlets. These have recently been discussed in the literature in the context of O-type stars and we show that they persist in the early B-types. Our approach improves on published pure LTE models - widely applied for OB star analyses - in many aspects: non-LTE strengthening and the use of improved line-broadening data result in significant differences in the line profiles and equivalent widths of the Balmer and helium lines. Where possible, systematic effects on the stellar parameter determination are quantified, e.g. gravities derived from the Hgamma wings may be overestimated by up to ~0.2 dex for dwarfs at our upper temperature boundary of 35 000 K in LTE.

	Abstract = {We present a catalog of 1750 massive stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with accurate spectral types compiled from the literature, and a photometric catalog for a subset of 1268 of these stars, with the goal of exploring their infrared properties. The photometric catalog consists of stars with infrared counterparts in the Spitzer SAGE survey database, for which we present uniform photometry from 0.3 to 24 mum in the UBVIJHKs +IRAC+MIPS24 bands. The resulting infrared color-magnitude diagrams illustrate that the supergiant B[e], red supergiant, and luminous blue variable (LBV) stars are among the brightest infrared point sources in the LMC, due to their intrinsic brightness, and at longer wavelengths, due to dust. We detect infrared excesses due to free-free emission among ~900 OB stars, which correlate with luminosity class. We confirm the presence of dust around 10 supergiant B[e] stars, finding the shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to be very similar, in contrast to the variety of SED shapes among the spectrally variable LBVs. The similar luminosities of B[e] supergiants (log L/L sun >= 4) and the rare, dusty progenitors of the new class of optical transients (e.g., SN 2008S and NGC 300 OT), plus the fact that dust is present in both types of objects, suggests a common origin for them. We find the infrared colors for Wolf-Rayet stars to be independent of spectral type and their SEDs to be flatter than what models predict. The results of this study provide the first comprehensive roadmap for interpreting luminous, massive, resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies at infrared wavelengths.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the stellar population and star formation history of the Upper Scorpius OB association, the most nearby region of recent massive star formation, over the full stellar mass range from 0.1 to 20 Msolar. The first part of this paper describes an extension of our large spectroscopic survey (Preibisch et al., published in 2001) for low-mass pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in Upper Scorpius. Using the multiobject spectrograph 2dF at the Anglo-Australian Telescope, we obtained spectra of 469 stars with magnitudes R=12.5-18.0 in a 6 deg2 area. Among these, we find 68 new PMS stars, nearly all of them M-type stars, by their strong lithium absorption lines. The total area covered by our 2dF survey is now 9 deg2 and contains 166 new PMS stars. Combining these results with our earlier investigation (Preibisch & Zinnecker) yields a sample of 250 PMS stars in the mass range ~0.1 to ~2 Msolar. The location of these stars in the HR diagram suggests a mean age of 5 Myr without a significant age spread. In the second part of this paper, we also consider the population of 114 high-mass members identified in detailed Hipparcos studies. We construct a combined HR diagram for the 364 high- and low-mass members and find that the whole stellar population is very well characterized by a very narrow age distribution around 5 Myr. We estimate individual masses for all members and construct an empirical mass function covering the mass range from 0.1 up to 20 Msolar. A power-law fit to the mass function gives a slope of alpha~-2.6 above ~2 Msolar and a much flatter slope (alpha~-0.9) below ~0.6 Msolar. The initial mass function of Upper Sco is not identical, but within the errors consistent with recent determinations of the field initial mass function. There is certainly no deficit of low-mass stars in the Upper Sco OB association, but rather a small excess of low-mass stars. Our results on the stellar age distribution confirm earlier indications that the star formation process in Upper Sco was triggered and support previous conjectures that the triggering event was a supernova shock wave originating from the nearby Upper Centaurus-Lupus association.},

Mass-loss rates for standard metallicity-dependent winds of hot stars are lower by a factor of 2-3 compared with rates adopted in modern stellar evolution codes, due to the influence of clumping on observed diagnostics. Weaker hot star winds shift the burden of H-envelope removal to the winds, pulsations, and eruptions of evolved supergiants, as well as binary mass transfer. Studies of stripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer. Dramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which have massive shells ejected just a few years earlier. These eruptions are a prelude to core collapse, and may signify severe instabilities in the latest nuclear burning phases. We encounter the predicament that the most important modes of mass loss are also the most uncertain, undermining the predictive power of single-star evolution models. Moreover, the influence of winds and rotation has been evaluated by testing single-star models against observed statistics that, it turns out, are heavily influenced by binary evolution. Altogether, this may alter our view about the most basic outcomes of massive-star mass loss---are Wolf-Rayet stars and Type Ibc supernovae the products of winds, or are they mostly the result of binary evolution and eruptive mass loss? This is not fully settled, but mounting evidence points toward the latter. This paradigm shift impacts other areas of astronomy, because it changes predictions for ionizing radiation and wind feedback from stellar populations, it may alter conclusions about star-formation rates and initial mass functions, it affects the origin of compact stellar remnants, and it influences how we use supernovae as probes of stellar evolution across cosmic time.},

	Abstract = {Early Release Science observations of the cluster NGC 3603 with the WFC3 on the refurbished Hubble Space Telescope allow us to study its recent star formation history. Our analysis focuses on stars with Halpha excess emission, a robust indicator of their pre-main sequence (PMS) accreting status. The comparison with theoretical PMS isochrones shows that 2/3 of the objects with Halpha excess emission have ages from 1 to 10 Myr, with a median value of 3 Myr, while a surprising 1/3 of them are older than 10 Myr. The study of the spatial distribution of these PMS stars allows us to confirm their cluster membership and to statistically separate them from field stars. This result establishes unambiguously for the first time that star formation in and around the cluster has been ongoing for at least 10-20 Myr, at an apparently increasing rate.},

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic and photometric determination of the distance to the young Galactic open cluster Westerlund 2 using WFPC2 imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based optical spectroscopy. HST imaging in the F336W, F439W, F555W, and F814W filters resolved many sources previously undetected in ground-based observations and yielded photometry for 1136 stars. We identified 15 new O-type stars, along with two probable binary systems, including MSP 188 (O3 + O5.5). We fit reddened spectral energy distributions based on the Padova isochrones to the photometric data to determine individual reddening parameters RV and AV for O-type stars in Wd2. We find average values langRV rang = 3.77 $\pm$ 0.09 and langAV rang = 6.51 $\pm$ 0.38 mag, which result in a smaller distance than most other spectroscopic and photometric studies. After a statistical distance correction accounting for close unresolved binaries (factor of 1.08), our spectroscopic and photometric data on 29 O-type stars yield that Westerlund 2 has a distance langdrang = 4.16 $\pm$ 0.07 (random) +0.26 (systematic) kpc. The cluster's age remains poorly constrained, with an upper limit of 3 Myr. Finally, we report evidence of a faint mid-IR polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ring surrounding the well-known binary candidate MSP 18, which appears to lie at the center of a secondary stellar grouping within Westerlund 2.

	Abstract = {Context. The distance of the very young open cluster Westerlund 2, which contains the very massive binary system WR 20a and is likely associated with a TeV source, has been the subject of much debate.  Aims: We attempt a joint analysis of spectroscopic and photometric data of eclipsing binaries in the cluster to constrain its distance.  Methods: A sample of 15 stars, including three eclipsing binaries (MSP 44, MSP 96, and MSP 223) was monitored with the FLAMES multi-object spectrograph. The spectroscopic data are analysed together with existing B V photometry.  Results: The analysis of the three eclipsing binaries clearly supports the larger values of the distance, around 8 kpc, and rules out values of about 2.4 - 2.8 kpc that have been suggested in the literature. Furthermore, our spectroscopic monitoring reveals no clear signature of binarity with periods shorter than 50 days in either the WN6ha star WR 20b, the early O-type stars MSP 18, MSP 171, MSP 182, MSP 183, MSP 199, and MSP 203, or three previously unknown mid O-type stars. The only newly identified candidate binary system is MSP 167. The absence of a binary signature is especially surprising for WR 20b and MSP 18, which were previously found to be bright X-ray sources.  Conclusions: The distance of Westerlund 2 is confirmed to be around 8 kpc as previously suggested based on the spectrophotometry of its population of O-type stars and the analysis of the light curve of WR 20a. Our results suggest that short-period binary systems are not likely to be common, at least not among the population of O-type stars in the cluster.

	Abstract = {We investigate the massive star content of NGC 3603, the closest known giant H II region. We have obtained spectra of 26 stars in the central cluster using the Baade 6.5 m telescope (Magellan I). Of these 26 stars, 16 had no previous spectroscopy. We also obtained photometry of all of the stars with previous or new spectroscopy, primarily using archival HST Advanced Camera for Surveys/High-Resolution Camera images. The total number of stars that have been spectroscopically classified in NGC 3603 now stands at 38. The sample is dominated by very early O-type stars (O3); there are also several (previously identified) H-rich WN+abs stars. We derive E(B - V) = 1.39, and find that there is very little variation in reddening across the cluster core, in agreement with previous studies. Our spectroscopic parallax is consistent with the kinematic distance only if the ratio of total to selective extinction is anomalously high within the cluster, as argued by Pandey et al. Adopting their reddening, we derive a distance of 7.6 kpc. We discuss the various distance estimates to the cluster, and note that although there has been a wide range of values in the recent literature (6.3-10.1 kpc) there is actually good agreement with the apparent distance modulus of the cluster---the disagreement has been the result of the uncertain reddening correction. We construct our H-R diagram using the apparent distance modulus with a correction for the slight difference in differential reddening from star to star. The resulting H-R diagram reveals that the most massive stars are highly coeval, with an age of 1-2 Myr, and of very high masses (120 Msun). The three stars with Wolf-Rayet features are the most luminous and massive, and are coeval with the non-WRs, in accord with what was found in the R136 cluster. There may be a larger age spread (1-4 Myr) for the lower mass objects (20-40 Msun). Two supergiants (an OC9.7 I and the B1 I star Sher 25) both have an age of about 4 Myr. We compare the stellar content of this cluster to that of R136, finding that the number of very high luminosity (Mbol <= -10) stars is only about 1.1-2.4× smaller in NGC 3603. The most luminous members in both clusters are H-rich WN+abs stars, basically "Of stars on steroids," relatively unevolved stars whose high luminosities results in high-mass loss rates, and hence spectra that mimic that of evolved WNs. To derive an initial-mass function for the massive stars in NGC 3603 requires considerably more spectroscopy; we estimate from a color-magnitude diagram that less than a third of the stars with masses above 20 Msun have spectral types known.  This paper is based on data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a large intermediate-resolution spectroscopic survey for pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in the Upper Scorpius OB association, the nearest region of recent massive star formation. Utilizing the 2dF multiobject spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope, we obtained spectra of 576 stars with magnitudes 12.5<=R<=16.5 in a 6 deg2 area in Upper Scorpius. Among these objects we were able to identify 98 new PMS stars, nearly all of them M-type stars, by their strong lithium absorption lines. We place the new PMS stars into the H-R diagram and find that their ages agree well with the mean age of 5 Myr determined in our earlier investigation based on a smaller sample of stars. The number of low-mass (0.1 Msolar<~M*<~0.5 Msolar) members is at least as high as expected from the known number of high-mass (M*>~3 Msolar) association members and from recent determinations of the field star initial mass function. Thus, there is no deficit of low-mass stars in Upper Scorpius.},

	Abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESA star. Improvements in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M &sun; stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESA star results.},

	Abstract = {We have analyzed two epochs of HST/WFPC2 observations of the young Galactic starburst cluster in NGC 3603 with the aim to study its internal dynamics and stellar population. Relative proper motions measured over 10.15 yrs of more than 800 stars enable us to distinguish cluster members from field stars. The best-fitting isochrone yields A V = 4.6-4.7 mag, a distance of 6.6-6.9 kpc, and an age of 1 Myr for NGC 3603 Young Cluster (NYC). We identify pre-main-sequence/main-sequence transition stars located in the short-lived radiative-convective gap, which in the NYC occurs in the mass range 3.5-3.8 M sun. We also identify a sparse population of stars with an age of 4 Myr, which appear to be the lower mass counterparts to previously discovered blue supergiants located in the giant H II region NGC 3603. For the first time, we are able to measure the internal velocity dispersion of a starburst cluster from 234 stars with I < 18.5 mag to sigmapm1D = 141 $\pm$ 27muas yr-1 (4.5 $\pm$ 0.8 km s-1 at a distance of 6.75 kpc). As stars with masses between 1.7 and 9 M sun all exhibit the same velocity dispersion, the cluster stars have not yet reached equipartition of kinetic energy (i.e., the cluster is not in virial equilibrium). The results highlight the power of combining high-precision astrometry and photometry, and emphasize the role of NYC as a benchmark object for testing stellar evolution models and dynamical models for young clusters, and as a template for extragalactic starburst clusters.},

	Abstract = {A quantitative spectral analysis of 24 A supergiants in the Sculptor Group spiral galaxy NGC 300 at a distance of 1.9 Mpc is presented. A new method is introduced to analyze low-resolution (~5 {\AA}) spectra, which yields metallicities accurate to 0.2 dex including the uncertainties arising from the errors in Teff (5%) and log g (0.2 dex). For the first time the stellar metallicity gradient based on elements such as titanium and iron in a galaxy beyond the Local Group is investigated. Solar metallicity is measured in the center and 0.3 solar in the outskirts and a logarithmic gradient of -0.08 dex kpc-1. An average reddening of E(B - V) ~ 0.12 mag is obtained, however, with a large variation from 0.07 to 0.24 mag. We also determine stellar radii, luminosities, and masses and discuss the evolutionary status. Finally, the observed relationship between absolute bolometric magnitudes Mbol and flux-weighted gravities gF = g/T4eff is investigated. At high temperatures the strength of the Balmer lines depends solely on the flux-weighted gravity, which allows a precise direct determination of log gF with an accuracy of 0.05-0.1 dex. We find a tight relationship between Mbol and log gF in agreement with stellar evolution theory. Combining these new results with previous work on Local Group galaxies, we obtain a new flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relationship (FGLR), which is very well defined and appears to be an excellent alternative tool to determine distances to galaxies.

	Abstract = {Stellar evolution calculations predict the flux-weighted gravity g/T4eff and absolute bolometric magnitude of blue supergiants to be strongly correlated. We use medium-resolution multiobject spectroscopy of late B and early A supergiants in two spiral galaxies, NGC 300 and NGC 3621, to demonstrate the existence of such a relationship, which proves to be surprisingly tight. An analysis of high-resolution spectra of blue supergiants in Local Group galaxies confirms this detection. We discuss the application of the relationship for extragalactic distance determinations and conservatively conclude that once properly calibrated it has the potential to allow for measurements of distance moduli out to 30.5 mag with an accuracy of 0.1 mag or better.

	Abstract = {We present results from deep and very spatially extended CTIO/DECam $g$ and $r$ photometry (reaching out to $\sim$ 2 mag below the oldest MSTO and covering $\sim$ 20 deg$^2$) around the Sextans dSph. We use this data-set to study the structural properties of Sextans overall stellar population and its different stellar evolutionary phases, as well as to search for signs of tidal disturbance from the MW, which would indicate departure from dynamical equilibrium. We perform the most accurate structural analysis to-date of Sextans' stellar components by applying Bayesian MCMC methods to the individual stars' positions. Surface density maps are built by decontaminating the sample through a matched filter analysis of the CMD, and then analysed for departures from axisymmetry. Sextans is found to be considerably less spatially extended than early studies suggested. No significant distortions or tidal disturbances are found down to a surface brightness of $\sim$ 31.8 mag/arcsec$^{-2}$ in V-band. We identify an overdensity in the central regions that may correspond to previously reported kinematic substructure(s). In agreement with previous findings, old $\&$ metal-poor stars such as BHB stars cover a much larger area than stars in other evolutionary phases, and bright BSs are less spatially extended than faint ones. However, the different spatial distribution of bright and faint BSs appears consistent with the general age/metallicity gradients found in Sextans' stellar component. This is compatible with BSs having formed by evolution of binaries and not necessarily due to the presence of a central disrupted globular cluster, as suggested in the literature. We provide structural parameters for the various populations analyzed and make publicly available the photometric catalogue of point-sources as well as a catalogue of literature spectroscopic measurements with updated membership probabilities.},

@article{Richardson:2011kb,
	Abstract = {We present the discovery of five new dwarf galaxies, Andromeda XXIII-XXVII, located in the outer halo of M31. These galaxies were discovered during the second year of data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS), a photometric survey of the M31/M33 subgroup conducted with the MegaPrime/MegaCam wide-field camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The current PAndAS survey now provides an almost complete panoramic view of the M31 halo out to an average projected radius of ~150 kpc. Here we present for the first time the metal-poor stellar density map for this whole region, not only as an illustration of the discovery space for satellite galaxies, but also as a birds-eye view of the ongoing assembly process of an L * disk galaxy. Four of the newly discovered satellites appear as well-defined spatial overdensities of stars lying on the expected locus of metal-poor (-2.5 < [Fe/H] < -1.3) red giant branch stars at the distance of M31. The fifth overdensity, And XXVII, is embedded in an extensive stream of such stars and is possibly the remnant of a strong tidal disruption event. Based on distance estimates from horizontal branch magnitudes, all five have metallicities typical of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ranging from [Fe/H] =-1.7 $\pm$ 0.2 to [Fe/H] =-1.9 $\pm$ 0.2 and absolute magnitudes ranging from MV = -7.1 $\pm$ 0.5 to MV = -10.2 $\pm$ 0.5. These five additional satellites bring the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in this region to 25 and continue the trend whereby the brighter dwarf spheroidal satellites of M31 generally have much larger half-light radii than their Milky Way counterparts. With an extended sample of M31 satellite galaxies, we also revisit the spatial distribution of this population and in particular we find that, within the current projected limits of the PAndAS survey, the surface density of satellites is essentially constant out to 150 kpc. This corresponds to a radial density distribution of satellites varying as r -1, a result seemingly in conflict with the predictions of cosmological simulations.  Based on observations obtained with the MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and CEA/DAPNIA, at CFHT which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

	Abstract = {We present initial results from a population synthesis model aimed at determining the star formation rate (SFR) of the Milky Way. We find that a total SFR of 0.68-1.45 M sun yr-1 is able to reproduce the observed number of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Spitzer/IRAC GLIMPSE survey of the Galactic plane, assuming simple prescriptions for the three-dimensional Galactic distributions of YSOs and interstellar dust, and using model spectral energy distributions to predict the brightness and color of the synthetic YSOs at different wavelengths. This is the first Galaxy-wide measurement derived from pre-main-sequence objects themselves, rather than global observables such as the total radio continuum, Halpha, or FIR flux. The value obtained is slightly lower than, but generally consistent with previously determined values. We will extend this method in the future to fit the brightness, color, and angular distribution of YSOs, and simultaneously make use of multiple surveys, to place constraints on the input assumptions, and reduce uncertainties in the SFR estimate. Ultimately, this will be one of the most accurate methods for determining the Galactic SFR, as it makes use of stars of all masses (limited only by sensitivity) rather than solely massive stars or indirect tracers of massive stars.},

	Abstract = {The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies are shaped by nearly every physical property of the system, including the star-formation history, metal content, abundance pattern, dust mass, grain size distribution, star-dust geometry, and interstellar radiation field. The principal goal of stellar population synthesis (SPS) is to extract these variables from observed SEDs. In this review I provide an overview of the SPS technique and discuss what can be reliably measured from galaxy SEDs. Topics include stellar masses, star-formation rates and histories, metallicities and abundance patterns, dust properties, and the stellar initial mass function.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a previously unknown massive Galactic star cluster at ell = 29fdg22, b = -0fdg20. Identified visually in mid-IR images from the Spitzer GLIMPSE survey, the cluster contains at least eight late-type supergiants, based on follow-up near-IR spectroscopy, and an additional 3-6 candidate supergiant members having IR photometry consistent with a similar distance and reddening. The cluster lies at a local minimum in the 13CO column density and 8 mum emission. We interpret this feature as a hole carved by the energetic winds of the evolving massive stars. The 13CO hole seen in molecular maps at V LSR ~ 95 km s-1 corresponds to near/far kinematic distances of 6.1/8.7 $\pm$ 1 kpc. We calculate a mean spectrophotometric distance of 7.0+3.7 -2.4 kpc, broadly consistent with the kinematic distances inferred. This location places it near the northern end of the Galactic bar. For the mean extinction of AV = 12.6 $\pm$ 0.5 mag (AK = 1.5 $\pm$ 0.1 mag), the color-magnitude diagram of probable cluster members is well fit by isochrones in the age range 18-24 Myr. The estimated cluster mass is ~20,000 M sun. With the most massive original cluster stars likely deceased, no strong radio emission is detected in this vicinity. As such, this red supergiant (RSG) cluster is representative of adolescent massive Galactic clusters that lie hidden behind many magnitudes of dust obscuration. This cluster joins two similar RSG clusters as residents of the volatile region where the end of our Galaxy's bar joins the base of the Scutum-Crux spiral arm, suggesting a recent episode of widespread massive star formation there.},

	Abstract = {We report on the unprecedented red supergiant (RSG) population of a massive young cluster, located at the base of the Scutum-Crux Galactic arm. We identify candidate cluster RSGs based on 2MASS photometry and medium-resolution spectroscopy. With follow-up high-resolution spectroscopy, we use CO band-head equivalent width and high-precision radial velocity measurements to identify a core grouping of 26 physically associated RSGs-the largest such cluster known to date. Using the stars' velocity dispersion and their inferred luminosities in conjunction with evolutionary models, we argue that the cluster has an initial mass of ~40,000 Msolar and is therefore among the most massive in the galaxy. Further, the cluster is only a few hundred parsecs away from the cluster of 14 RSGs recently reported by Figer at al.. These two RSG clusters represent 20% of all known RSGs in the Galaxy, and now offer the unique opportunity to study the presupernova evolution of massive stars, and the blue- to red-supergiant ratio at uniform metallicity. We use GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, and MAGPIS survey data to identify several objects in the field of the larger cluster which seem to be indicative of recent regionwide starburst activity at the point where the Scutum-Crux arm intercepts the Galactic bulge. Future abundance studies of these clusters will therefore permit the study of the chemical evolution and metallicity gradient of the Galaxy in the region where the disk meets the bulge.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of an extraordinarily massive young cluster of stars in the Galaxy, having an inferred total initial cluster mass comparable to the most massive young clusters in the Galaxy. Using IRMOS, 2MASS, and Spitzer observations, we conclude that there are 14 red supergiants in the cluster, compared with five, in what was previously thought to be the richest Galactic cluster of such stars. We infer spectral types from near-infrared spectra that reveal deep CO bandhead absorption that can only be fit by red supergiants. We identify a gap of DeltaKs~4 mag between the stars and the bulk of the other stars in the region that can only be fit by models if the brightest stars in the cluster are red supergiants. We estimate a distance of 5.8 kpc to the cluster by associating an OH maser with the envelope of one of the stars. We also identify a ``yellow'' supergiant of G6 I type in the cluster. Assuming a Salpeter IMF, we infer an initial cluster mass of 20,000-40,000 Msolar for cluster ages of 7-12 Myr. Continuing with these assumptions, we find that 80% of the initial mass and 99% of the number of stars remain at the present time. We associate the cluster with an X-ray source (detected by ASCA and Einstein), a recently discovered very high energy gamma-ray source (detected by INTEGRAL and HESS), and several nonthermal radio sources, finding that these objects are likely related to recent supernovae in the cluster. In particular, we claim that the cluster has produced at least one recent supernova remnant with properties similar to the Crab Nebula.},

	Abstract = {We present new high-resolution near-IR spectroscopy and OH maser observations to investigate the population of cool luminous stars of the young massive Galactic cluster RSGC1. Using the 2.293 mum CO band-head feature, we make high-precision radial velocity measurements of 16 of the 17 candidate red supergiants (RSGs) identified by Figer et al. We show that F16 and F17 are foreground stars, while we confirm that the rest are indeed physically associated RSGs. We determine that star F15, also associated with the cluster, is a yellow hypergiant based on its luminosity and spectroscopic similarity to rho Cas. Using the cluster's radial velocity, we have derived the kinematic distance to the cluster and revisited the stars' temperatures and luminosities. We find a larger spread of luminosities than in the discovery paper, consistent with a cluster age 30% older than previously thought (12 +/- 2 Myr), and a total initial mass of (3 +/- 1) × 104 M&sun;. The spatial coincidence of the OH maser with F13, combined with similar radial velocities, is compelling evidence that the two are related. Combining our results with recent SiO and H2O maser observations, we find that those stars with maser emission are the most luminous in the cluster. From this we suggest that the maser active phase is associated with the end of the RSG stage, when the luminosity-mass ratios are at their highest.},

	Abstract = {FSPS is a flexible SPS package that allows the user to compute simple stellar populations (SSPs) for a range of IMFs and metallicities, and for a variety of assumptions regarding the morphology of the horizontal branch, the blue straggler population, the post--AGB phase, and the location in the HR diagram of the TP-AGB phase.  From these SSPs the user may then generate composite stellar populations (CSPs) for a variety of star formation histories (SFHs) and dust attenuation prescriptions.  Outputs include the "observed" spectra and magnitudes of the SSPs and CSPs at arbitrary redshift.  In addition to these fortran routines, several IDL routines are provided that allow easy manipulation of the output. FSPS was designed with the intention that the user would make full use of the provided fortran routines.  However, the full FSPS package is quite large, and requires some time for the user to become familiar with all of the options and syntax.  Some users may only need SSPs for a range of metallicities and IMFs.  For such users, standard SSP sets for several IMFs, evolutionary tracks, and spectral libraries are available here.},

	Abstract = {Cygnus OB2 is the most massive association within 2 kpc from the Sun, hosting hundreds of massive stars, thousands of young low mass members, and some sights of active star formation in the surrounding cloud. Recently, 10 photoevaporating proplyd-like objects with tadpole-shaped morphology were discovered in the outskirts of the OB association, approximately 6-14 pc away from its center. The classification of these objects is ambiguous, being either evaporating residuals of the parental cloud that are hosting a protostar inside or disk-bearing stars with an evaporating disk, such as the evaporating proplyds observed in the Trapezium Cluster in Orion. In this paper, we present a study based on low-resolution optical spectroscopic observations made with the Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy, mounted on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS, of two of these protostars. The spectrum of one of the objects shows evidence of accretion but not of outflows. In the latter object, the spectra show several emission lines indicating the presence of an actively accreting disk with outflow. We present estimates of the mass loss rate and the accretion rate from the disk, showing that the former exceeds the latter as observed in other known objects with evaporating disks. We also show evidence of a strong variability in the integrated flux observed in these objects as well as in the accretion and outflow diagnostics.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of spectroscopy of four bright proplyds in the Orion Nebula obtained at a velocity resolution of 6 km s-1. After careful isolation of the proplyd spectra from the confusing nebular radiation, the emission-line profiles are compared with those predicted by realistic dynamic/photoionization models of the objects. The spectral line widths show a clear correlation with ionization potential, which is consistent with the free expansion of a transonic, ionization-stratified, photoevaporating flow. Fitting models of such a flow simultaneously to our spectra and HST emission-line imaging provides direct measurements of the proplyd size, ionized density, and outflow velocity. These measurements confirm that the ionization front in the proplyds is approximately D-critical and provide the most accurate and robust estimate to date of the proplyd mass-loss rate. Values of (0.7-1.5)x10-6 Msolar yr-1 are found for our spectroscopic sample, although extrapolating our results to a larger sample of proplyds implies that 0.4x10-6 Msolar yr-1 is more typical of the proplyds as a whole. In view of the reported limits on the masses of the circumstellar disks within the proplyds, the length of time that they can have been exposed to ionizing radiation should not greatly exceed 104 yr-a factor of 30 less than the mean age of the proplyd stars. We review the various mechanisms that have been proposed to explain this situation, and conclude that none can plausibly work unless the disk masses are revised upward by a substantial amount.},

	Abstract = {Context. One mechanism for the external destruction of protoplanetary discs in young dense clusters is tidal disruption during the flyby of another cluster member. The degree of mass loss in such an encounter depends, among other parameters, on the distribution of the material within the disc. Previous work showed that this is especially so in encounters that truncate large parts of the outer disc. The expectation is that the number of completely destroyed discs in a cluster also depends on the mass distribution within the discs.  Aims: Here we test this hypothesis by determining the influence of encounters on the disc fraction and average disc mass in clusters of various stellar densities for different mass distributions in the discs.  Methods: This is done by performing nbody6simulations of a variety of cluster environments, where we track the encounter dynamics and determine the mass loss due to these encounters for different disc-mass distributions.  Results: We find that although the disc-mass distribution has a significant impact on the disc losses for specific star-disc encounters, the overall disc frequency generally remains unaffected. The reason is that in single encounters the dependence on the mass distribution is strongest if both stars have very different masses. Such encounters are rather infrequent in sparse clusters. In dense clusters these encounters are more common; however, here the disc frequency is largely determined by encounters between low-mass stars such that the overall disc frequency does not change significantly.  Conclusions: For tidal disruption the disc destruction in clusters is fairly independent of the actual distribution of the material in the disc. The all determining factor remains the cluster density.},

	Abstract = {Most stars form in a clustered environment. Therefore, it is important to assess how this environment influences the evolution of protoplanetary discs around young stars. In turn, this affects their ability to produce planets and ultimately life. We present here for the first time 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics/N-body simulations that include both the hydrodynamical evolution of the discs around their natal stars, as well as the dynamics of the stars themselves. The discs are viscously evolving, accreting mass on to the central star and spreading. We find penetrating encounters to be very destructive for the discs as in previous studies, although the frequency of such encounters is low. We also find, however, that encounter influence the disc radii more strongly than other disc properties such as the disc mass. The disc sizes are set by the competition between viscous spreading and the disruptive effect of encounters. As discs spread, encounters become more and more important. In the regime of rapid spreading, encounters simply truncate the discs, stripping the outer portions. In the opposite regime, we find that the effect of many distant encounters is able to limit the disc size. Finally, we predict from our simulations that disc sizes are limited by encounters at stellar densities exceeding ˜2-3 × 103 pc-2.},

@article{Guarcello:2016vn,
	Abstract = {In our Galaxy, star formation occurs in a variety of environments, with a large fraction of stars formed in clusters hosting massive stars. OB stars have an important feedback on the evolution of protoplanetary disks around nearby young stars and likely on the process of planet formation occurring in them. The nearby massive association Cygnus OB2 is an outstanding laboratory to study this feedback. It is the closest massive association to our Sun, and hosts hundreds of massive stars and thousands of low mass members. In this paper, we analyze the spatial variation of the disk fraction in Cygnus OB2 and we study its correlation with the local values of Far and Extreme ultraviolet radiation fields and the local stellar surface density. We present definitive evidence that disks are more rapidly dissipated in the regions of the association characterized by intense local UV field and large stellar density. In particular, the FUV radiation dominates disks dissipation timescales in the proximity (i.e. within 0.5 pc) of the O stars. In the rest of the association, EUV photons potentially induce a significant mass loss from the irradiated disks across the entire association, but the efficiency of this process is reduced at increasing distances from the massive stars due to absorption by the intervening intracluster material. We find that disk dissipation due to close stellar encounters is negligible in Cygnus OB2, and likely to have affected 1% or fewer of the stellar population. Disk dissipation is instead dominated by photoevaporation. We also compare our results to what has been found in other young clusters with different massive populations, concluding that massive associations like Cygnus OB2 are potentially hostile to protoplanetary disks, but that the environments where disks can safely evolve in planetary systems are likely quite common in our Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {Most stars form in a cluster environment. These stars are initially surrounded by disks from which potentially planetary systems form. Of all cluster environments, starburst clusters are probably the most hostile for planetary systems in our Galaxy. The intense stellar radiation and extreme density favor rapid destruction of circumstellar disks via photoevaporation and stellar encounters. Evolving a virialized model of the Arches cluster in the Galactic tidal field, we investigate the effect of stellar encounters on circumstellar disks in a prototypical starburst cluster. Despite its proximity to the deep gravitational potential of the Galactic center, only a moderate fraction of members escapes to form an extended pair of tidal tails. Our simulations show that encounters destroy one-third of the circumstellar disks in the cluster core within the first 2.5 Myr of evolution, preferentially affecting the least and most massive stars. A small fraction of these events causes rapid ejection and the formation of a weaker second pair of tidal tails that is overpopulated by disk-poor stars. Two predictions arise from our study. (1) If not destroyed by photoevaporation protoplanetary disks of massive late B- and early O-type stars represent the most likely hosts of planet formation in starburst clusters. (2) Multi-epoch K- and L-band photometry of the Arches cluster would provide the kinematically selected membership sample required to detect the additional pair of disk-poor tidal tails.},

	Abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope has imaged the central part of M87 over a 10 week span, leading to the discovery of 32 classical novae (CNe) and nine fainter, likely very slow, and/or symbiotic novae. In this first paper of a series, we present the M87 nova finder charts, and the light and color curves of the novae. We demonstrate that the rise and decline times, and the colors of M87 novae are uncorrelated with each other and with position in the galaxy. The spatial distribution of the M87 novae follows the light of the galaxy, suggesting that novae accreted by M87 during cannibalistic episodes are well-mixed. Conservatively using only the 32 brightest CNe we derive a nova rate for M87: {363}-45+33 novae yr-1. We also derive the luminosity-specific classical nova rate for this galaxy, which is {7.88}-2.6+2.3 {{yr}}-1/{10}10 {L}&sun; {,}K. Both rates are 3-4 times higher than those reported for M87 in the past, and similarly higher than those reported for all other galaxies. We suggest that most previous ground-based surveys for novae in external galaxies, including M87, miss most faint, fast novae, and almost all slow novae near the centers of galaxies.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Assembling a catalog of at least 10,000 Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars is an essential step in proving (or disproving) that these stars are the progenitors of Type Ib and Type Ic supernovae. To this end, we have used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to carry out a deep, He II optical narrowband imaging survey of the ScI spiral galaxy M101. Almost the entire galaxy was imaged with the unprecedented depth and resolution that only the HST affords. Differenced with archival broadband images, the narrowband images allow us to detect much of the W-R star population of M101. We describe the extent of the survey and our images, as well as our data reduction procedures. A detailed broadband-narrowband imaging study of a field east of the center of M101, containing the giant star-forming region NGC 5462, demonstrates our completeness limits, how we find W-R candidates, their properties and spatial distribution, and how we rule out most contaminants. We use the broadband images to locate luminous red supergiant (RSG) candidates. The spatial distributions of the W-R and RSG stars near NGC 5462 are strikingly different. W-R stars dominate the complex core, while RSGs dominate the complex halo. Future papers in this series will describe and catalog more than a thousand W-R and RSG candidates that are detectable in our images, as well as spectra of many of those candidates.},

	Abstract = {Three decades of searches have revealed 154 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in M31, with 62 of WC type, 92 of WN type and zero of transition-type WN/C or WC/N. In apparent contrast, about two per cent of the WR stars in the Galaxy, the LMC and M33 simultaneously display strong lines of carbon and nitrogen, i.e. they are transition-type WN/C or WC/N stars. We report here the serendipitous discovery of M31 WR 84-1, the first transition star in M31, located at RA = 00h43m43{^s.}61 Dec. = +41$\,^{\circ}$45'27{^''.}95 (J2000). We present its spectrum, classify it as WN5/WC6, and compare it with other known transition stars. The star is unresolved in Hubble Space Telescope narrow-band and broad-band images, while its spectrum displays strong, narrow emission lines of hydrogen, [N II], [S II] and [O III]; this indicates a nebula surrounding the star. The radial velocity of the nebular lines is consistent with that of gas at the same position in the disc of M31. The metallicity at the 11.8 kpc galactocentric distance of M31 WR 84-1 is approximately solar, consistent with other known transition stars. We suggest that modest numbers of reddened WR stars remain to be found in M31.},

	Abstract = {We first presented an isochrone data base that can be widely used for stellar population synthesis studies and colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting. The data base consists of the isochrones of both single-star and binary-star simple stellar populations (ss-SSPs and bs-SSPs). The ranges for the age and metallicity of populations are 0-15 Gyr and 0.0001-0.03, respectively. All data are available for populations with two widely used initial mass functions (IMFs), that is, Salpeter IMF and Chabrier IMF. The uncertainty caused by the data base (about 0.81 per cent) is designed to be smaller than those caused by the Hurley code and widely used stellar spectra libraries (e.g. BaSeL 3.1) when it is used for stellar population synthesis.  Based on the isochrone data base, we then built a rapid stellar population synthesis (RPS) model and calculated the high-resolution (0.3-{\AA}) integrated spectral energy distributions, Lick indices and colour indices for bs-SSPs and ss-SSPs. In particular, we calculated the UBVRIJHKLM colours, ugriz colours and some composite colours that consist of magnitudes on different systems. These colours are useful for disentangling the well-known stellar age-metallicity degeneracy according to our previous work.  As an example for applying the isochrone data base for CMD fitting, we fitted the CMDs of two star clusters (M67 and NGC1868) and obtained their distance moduli, colour excesses, stellar metallicities and ages. The results showed that the isochrones of bs-SSPs are closer to those of real star clusters. It suggests that we should take the effects of binary interactions into account in stellar population synthesis. We also discussed on the limitations of the application of the isochrone data base and the results of the RPS model.  All the data are available at the CDS or on request to the authors.

	Abstract = {The presence of a nearby companion alters the evolution of massive stars in binary systems, leading to phenomena such as stellar mergers, x-ray binaries, and gamma-ray bursts. Unambiguous constraints on the fraction of massive stars affected by binary interaction were lacking. We simultaneously measured all relevant binary characteristics in a sample of Galactic massive O stars and quantified the frequency and nature of binary interactions. More than 70% of all massive stars will exchange mass with a companion, leading to a binary merger in one-third of the cases. These numbers greatly exceed previous estimates and imply that binary interaction dominates the evolution of massive stars, with implications for populations of massive stars and their supernovae.},

	Abstract = {An overview of the known Wolf-Rayet (WR) population of the Milky Way is presented, including a brief overview of historical catalogues and recent advances based on infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations resulting in the current census of 642 (vl.13 online catalogue). The observed distribution of WR stars is considered with respect to known star clusters, given that <=20% of WR stars in the disk are located in clusters. WN stars outnumber WC stars at all galactocentric radii, while early-type WC stars are strongly biased against the inner Milky Way. Finally, recent estimates of the global WR population in the Milky Way are reassessed, with 1,200$\pm$100 estimated, such that the current census may be 50% complete. A characteristic WR lifetime of 0.25 Myr is inferred for an initial mass threshold of 25 M&sun;.},

	Abstract = {We have collated multiplicity data for five clusters (Taurus, Chamaeleon I, Ophiuchus, IC 348 and the Orion Nebula Cluster). We have applied the same mass ratio (flux ratios of DeltaK<= 2.5) and primary mass cuts (˜0.1-3.0 M&sun;) to each cluster and therefore have directly comparable binary statistics for all five clusters in the separation range 62-620 au, and for Taurus, Chamaeleon I and Ophiuchus in the range 18-830 au. We find that the trend of decreasing binary fraction with cluster density is solely due to the high binary fraction of Taurus; the other clusters show no obvious trend over a factor of nearly 20 in density.  With N-body simulations, we attempt to find a set of initial conditions that are able to reproduce the density, morphology and binary fractions of all five clusters. Only an initially clumpy (fractal) distribution with an initial total binary fraction of 73 per cent (17 per cent in the range 62-620 au) is able to reproduce all of the observations (albeit not very satisfactorily). Therefore, if star formation is universal, then the initial conditions must be clumpy and with a high (but not 100 per cent) binary fraction. This could suggest that most stars, including M dwarfs, form in binaries.},

	Abstract = {Binary populations in young star clusters show multiplicity fractions both lower and up to twice as high as those observed in the Galactic field. We follow the evolution of a population of binary stars in dense and loose star clusters starting with an invariant initial binary population and a formal multiplicity fraction of unity, and demonstrate that these models can explain the observed binary properties in Taurus, rho Ophiuchus, Chamaeleon, Orion, IC 348, Upper Scorpius A, Praesepe, and the Pleiades. The model needs to consider solely different birth densities for these regions. The evolved theoretical orbital-parameter distributions are highly probable parent distributions for the observed ones. We constrain the birth conditions (stellar mass, Mecl, and half-mass radius, rh) for the derived progenitors of the star clusters and the overall present-day binary fractions allowed by the present model. The results compare very well with properties of molecular cloud clumps on the verge of star formation. Combining these with previously and independently obtained constraints on the birth densities of globular clusters, we identify a weak stellar mass - half-mass radius correlation for cluster-forming cloud clumps, rh/pc ∝ (Mecl/M&sun;)0.13 $\pm$ 0.04. The ability of the model to reproduce the binary properties in all the investigated young objects, covering present-day densities from 1-10 stars pc-3 (Taurus) to 2 × 104 stars pc-3 (Orion), suggests that environment-dependent dynamical evolution plays an important role in shaping the present-day properties of binary populations in star clusters, and that the initial binary properties may not vary dramatically between different environments.},

	Abstract = {The Galactic open cluster Westerlund 1 was found only a few years ago to be much more massive than previously thought, with evidence suggesting its mass to be in excess of ~105 M&sun;, in the range spanned by young extragalactic star clusters. Unlike those clusters, its proximity makes spatially resolved studies of its stellar population feasible. It is therefore an ideal template for a young, massive star cluster, permitting direct comparison of its properties with measurements of velocity dispersion and dynamical mass for spatially unresolved extragalactic clusters. To this end, we used the long slit near-infrared spectrograph VLT/ISAAC to observe the CO bandhead region near 2.29 mum, scanning the slit across the cluster centre during the integration. Spatially collapsing the spectra along the slit results in a single co-added spectrum of the cluster, comparable to what one would obtain in the extragalactic cluster context. This spectrum was analysed in the same way as the spectra of almost point-like extragalactic clusters, using red superiant cluster members as velocity templates. We detected four red supergiants that are included in the integrated spectrum, and our measured velocity dispersion is 5.8 km s-1. Together with the cluster size of 0.86 pc, derived from archival near-infrared SOFI-NTT images, this yields a dynamical mass of 6.3×104 M&sun;. While this value is not to be considered the final word, there is at least so far no sign of rapid expansion or collapse.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, under program number 076.D-0680(A).},

	Abstract = {We present Gemini/GNIRS cross-dispersed near-infrared spectra of 12 nearby early-type galaxies, with the aim of testing commonly used stellar population synthesis models. We select a subset of galaxies from the atlas/ sample which span a wide range of ages (SSP-equivalent ages of 1--15~Gyr) at approximately solar metallicity. We derive star formation histories using four different stellar population synthesis models, namely those of [bruzual_stellar_2003], Conroy, Gunn \& White (2009; 2010), [maraston_stellar_2011] and [vazdekis_uv-extended_2016]. We compare star formation histories derived from near-infrared spectra with those derived from optical spectra using the same models. We find that while all models agree in the optical, the derived star formation histories vary dramatically from model to model in the near-infrared. We find that this variation is largely driven by the choice of stellar spectral library, such that models including high quality spectral libraries provide the best fits to the data, and are the most self-consistent when comparing optically-derived properties with near-infrared ones. We also find the impact of age variation in the near-infrared to be subtle, and largely encoded in the shape of the continuum, meaning that the common approach of removing continuum information with a high-order polynomial greatly reduces our ability to constrain ages in the near-infrared.},

	Abstract = {Using high-resolution data sets obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, we investigate the radial distributions of the F-type main-sequence binary fractions in the massive young Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters NGC 1805 and NGC 1818. We apply both an isochrone-fitting approach and chi2 minimization using Monte Carlo simulations, for different mass-ratio cut-offs, q, and present a detailed comparison of the methods' performance. Both methods yield the same radial binary fraction profile for the same cluster, which therefore supports the robustness and applicability of either method to young star clusters which are as yet unaffected by the presence of multiple stellar populations. The binary fractions in these two clusters are characterized by opposite trends in their radial profiles. NGC 1805 exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing radius in the central region, followed by a slow increase to the field's binary-fraction level, while NGC 1818 shows a monotonically increasing trend. This may indicate dominance of a more complicated physical mechanism in the cluster's central region than expected a priori. Time-scale arguments imply that early dynamical mass segregation should be very efficient and, hence, likely dominates the dynamical processes in the core of NGC 1805. Meanwhile, in NGC 1818 the behaviour in the core is probably dominated by disruption of soft binary systems. We speculate that this may be owing to the higher velocity dispersion in the NGC 1818 core, which creates an environment in which the efficiency of binary disruption is high compared with that in the NGC 1805 core.},

	Abstract = {The recent discovery of double main sequences in the young, massive star cluster NGC 1856 has caught significant attention. The observations can be explained by invoking two stellar generations with different ages and metallicities or by a single generation of stars composed of two populations characterized by different rotation rates. We analyzed the number ratios of stars belonging to both main-sequence components in NGC 1856 as a function of radius. We found that their number ratios remain approximately unchanged from the cluster's central region to its periphery, indicating that both components are homogeneously distributed in space. Through a comparison of the loci of the best-fitting isochrones with the ridge lines of both stellar components, we found that both multiple stellar populations and rapid stellar rotation can potentially explain the observed main-sequence bifurcation in NGC 1856. However, if NGC 1856 were a young representative of the old globular clusters, then the multiple stellar populations model would not be able to explain the observed homogeneity in the spatial distributions of these two components, since all relevant scenarios would predict that the second stellar generation should be formed in a more compact configuration than that of the first stellar generation, while NGC 1856 is too young for both stellar generations to have been fully mixed dynamically. We speculate that the rapid stellar rotation scenario would be the favored explanation of the observed multiple stellar sequences in NGC 1856.},

	Abstract = {Upon their formation, dynamically cool (collapsing) star clusters will, within only a few million years, achieve stellar mass segregation for stars down to a few solar masses, simply because of gravitational two-body encounters. Since binary systems are, on average, more massive than single stars, one would expect them to also rapidly mass segregate dynamically. Contrary to these expectations and based on high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope observations, we show that the compact, 15-30 Myr old Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1818 exhibits tantalizing hints at the >~ 2sigma level of significance (>3sigma if we assume a power-law secondary-to-primary mass-ratio distribution) of an increasing fraction of F-star binary systems (with combined masses of 1.3-1.6 M &sun;) with increasing distance from the cluster center, specifically between the inner 10''-20'' (approximately equivalent to the cluster's core and half-mass radii) and the outer 60''-80''. If confirmed, then this will offer support for the theoretically predicted but thus far unobserved dynamical disruption processes of the significant population of "soft" binary systems---with relatively low binding energies compared to the kinetic energy of their stellar members---in star clusters, which we have access to here by virtue of the cluster's unique combination of youth and high stellar density.},

	Abstract = {The massive (13,000-26,000 M &sun;) and young (15-30 Myr) Large Magellanic Cloud star cluster NGC 1818 reveals an unexpected increasing binary frequency with radius for F-type stars (1.3-2.2 M &sun;). This is in contrast to many older star clusters that show a decreasing binary frequency with radius. We study this phenomenon with sophisticated N-body modeling, exploring a range of initial conditions, from smooth virialized density distributions to highly substructured and collapsing configurations. We find that many of these models can reproduce the cluster's observed properties, although with a modest preference for substructured initial conditions. Our models produce the observed radial trend in binary frequency through disruption of soft binaries (with semi-major axes, a >~ 3000 AU), on approximately a crossing time (~5.4 Myr), preferentially in the cluster core. Mass segregation subsequently causes the binaries to sink toward the core. After roughly one initial half-mass relaxation time (t rh(0) ~ 340 Myr) the radial binary frequency distribution becomes bimodal, the innermost binaries having already segregated toward the core, leaving a minimum in the radial binary frequency distribution that marches outward with time. After 4-6 t rh(0), the rising distribution in the halo disappears, leaving a radial distribution that rises only toward the core. Thus, both a radial binary frequency distribution that falls toward the core (as observed for NGC 1818) and one that rises toward the core (as for older star clusters) can arise naturally from the same evolutionary sequence owing to binary disruption and mass segregation in rich star clusters.},

	Abstract = {Following on from a recently completed radial-velocity survey of the old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 in which we studied in detail the solar-type hard binaries and blue stragglers of the cluster, here we investigate the dynamical evolution of NGC 188 through a sophisticated N-body model. Importantly, we employ the observed binary properties of the young (180 Myr) open cluster M35, where possible, to guide our choices for parameters of the initial binary population. We apply pre-main-sequence tidal circularization and a substantial increase to the main-sequence tidal circularization rate, both of which are necessary to match the observed tidal circularization periods in the literature, including that of NGC 188. At 7 Gyr the main-sequence solar-type hard-binary population in the model matches that of NGC 188 in both binary frequency and distributions of orbital parameters. This agreement between the model and observations is in a large part due to the similarities between the NGC 188 and M35 solar-type binaries. Indeed, among the 7 Gyr main-sequence binaries in the model, only those with P >~ 1000 days begin to show potentially observable evidence for modifications by dynamical encounters, even after 7 Gyr of evolution within the star cluster. This emphasizes the importance of defining accurate initial conditions for star cluster models, which we propose is best accomplished through comparisons with observations of young open clusters like M35. Furthermore, this finding suggests that observations of the present-day binaries in even old open clusters can provide valuable information on their primordial binary populations. However, despite the model's success at matching the observed solar-type main-sequence population, the model underproduces blue stragglers and produces an overabundance of long-period circular main-sequence-white-dwarf binaries as compared with the true cluster. We explore several potential solutions to the paucity of blue stragglers and conclude that the model dramatically underproduces blue stragglers through mass-transfer processes. We suggest that common-envelope evolution may have been incorrectly imposed on the progenitors of the spurious long-period circular main-sequence-white-dwarf binaries, which perhaps instead should have gone through stable mass transfer to create blue stragglers, thereby bringing both the number and binary frequency of the blue straggler population in the model into agreement with the true blue stragglers in NGC 188. Thus, improvements in the physics of mass transfer and common-envelope evolution employed in the model may in fact solve both discrepancies with the observations. This project highlights the unique accessibility of open clusters to both comprehensive observational surveys and full-scale N-body simulations, both of which have only recently matured sufficiently to enable such a project, and underscores the importance of open clusters to the study of star cluster dynamics.

	Abstract = {We present the results of the first sensitive L-band (3.4 mum) imaging study of the nearby young embedded cluster NGC 2024. Two separate surveys of the cluster were acquired in order to obtain a census of the circumstellar disk fraction in the cluster. We detected 257 sources to the mL<=12.0 completeness limit of our ~110 arcmin2 primary survey region. An additional 26 sources with 12.0<L<14.0 were detected in the deeper survey of the central ~6.25 arcmin2 region of the cluster. From an analysis of the JHKL colors of all sources in our largest area, we find an infrared excess fraction of >=86%+/-8%. The JHKL colors suggest that the infrared excesses arise in circumstellar disks, indicating that the majority of the sources that formed in the NGC 2024 cluster are currently surrounded by, and likely formed with, circumstellar disks. The excess fractions remain very high, within the errors, even at the faintest L magnitudes from our deeper surveys, suggesting that disks form around the majority of the stars in very young clusters such as NGC 2024 independent of mass. From comparison with published JHKL observations of Taurus, we find the K-L excess fraction in NGC 2024 to be formally higher than in Taurus, although both fractions are quite high. Thus, existing L-band observations are consistent with a high initial incidence of circumstellar disks in both NGC 2024 and Taurus. Because NGC 2024 represents a region of much higher stellar density than Taurus, this suggests that disks may form around most of the YSOs in star-forming regions independent of environment. We find a relatively constant JHKL excess fraction with increasing cluster radius, indicating that the disk fraction is independent of location in the cluster. In contrast, the JHK excess fraction increases rapidly toward the central region of the cluster. The most likely cause for this increase is the contamination of the K-band measurements by bright nebulosity in the central regions of the cluster. This suggests that caution must be applied using only JHK-band observations to infer disk fractions in nebulous environments. Finally, we identify 45 candidate protostellar sources in the central regions of the cluster, and we find a lower limit on the protostellar phase of early stellar evolution in the NGC 2024 cluster of 0.4-1.4×105 yr, similar to that in Taurus.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of the first sensitive L-band survey of the intermediate-age (2.5-30 Myr) clusters NGC 2264, NGC 2362, and NGC 1960. We use JHKL colors to obtain a census of the circumstellar disk fractions in each cluster. We find disk fractions of 52%+/-10%, 12%+/-4%, and 3%+/-3% for the three clusters, respectively. Together with our previously published JHKL investigations of the younger NGC 2024, Trapezium, and IC 348 clusters, we have completed the first systematic and homogeneous survey for circumstellar disks in a sample of young clusters that both span a significant range in age (0.3-30 Myr) and contain statistically significant numbers of stars whose masses span nearly the entire stellar mass spectrum. Analysis of the combined survey indicates that the cluster disk fraction is initially very high (>=80%) and rapidly decreases with increasing cluster age, such that one-half the stars within the clusters lose their disks in <~3 Myr. Moreover, these observations yield an overall disk lifetime of ~6 Myr in the surveyed cluster sample. This is the timescale for essentially all the stars in a cluster to lose their disks. This should set a meaningful constraint for the planet-building timescale in stellar clusters. The implications of these results for current theories of planet formation are briefly discussed.},

@article{Feiden:2016iw,
	Abstract = {When determining absolute ages of identifiably young stellar populations, results strongly depend on which stars are studied. Cooler (K, M) stars typically yield ages that are systematically younger than warmer (A, F, G) stars by a factor of two. I explore the possibility that these age discrepancies are the result of magnetic inhibition of convection in cool young stars by using magnetic stellar evolution isochrones to determine the median age of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association. A median age of 10 Myr consistent across spectral types A through M is found, except for a subset of F-type stars that appear significantly older. Agreement is shown for ages derived from the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and from the empirical mass-radius relationship defined by eclipsing multiple-star systems. Surface magnetic field strengths required to produce agreement are approximately 2.5 kG and are predicted from a priori estimates of thermal equipartition values. A region in the HR diagram is identified that plausibly connects stars whose structures are weakly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields with those whose structures are strongly influenced by magnetic fields. The models suggest that this region is characterized by stars with rapidly thinning outer convective envelopes where the radiative core mass is greater than 75% of the total stellar mass. Furthermore, depletion of lithium predicted from magnetic models appears in better agreement with observed lithium equivalent widths than predictions from non-magnetic models. These results suggest that magnetic inhibition of convection plays an important role in the early evolution of low-mass stars and that it may be responsible for noted age discrepancies in young stellar populations.},

	Abstract = {We present a maximum-likelihood method for fitting two-dimensional model distributions to stellar data in colour-magnitude space. This allows one to include (for example) binary stars in an isochronal population. The method also allows one to derive formal uncertainties for fitted parameters, and assess the likelihood that a good fit has been found. We use the method to derive an age of 38.5+3.5-6.5 Myr and a true distance modulus of 7.79+0.11-0.05 mag from the V versus V - I diagram of NGC2547 (the uncertainties are 67 percent confidence limits, and the parameters are insensitive to the assumed binary fraction). These values are consistent with those previously determined from low-mass isochronal fitting, and are the first measurements to have statistically meaningful uncertainties. The age is also consistent with the lithium depletion age of NGC2547, and the Hipparcos distance to the cluster is consistent with our value.  The method appears to be quite general and could be applied to any N-dimensional data set, with uncertainties in each dimension. However, it is particularly useful when the data are sparse, in the sense that both the typical uncertainties for a data point and the size of structure in the function being fitted are small compared with the typical distance between data points. In this case binning the data will lose resolution, whilst the method presented here preserves it.  Software implementing the methods described in this paper is available from http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/timn/tau-squared/.},

	Abstract = {Astrophysicists are increasingly taking into account the effects of orbiting companions on stellar evolution. New discoveries have underlined the role of binary star interactions in a range of astrophysical events, including some that were previously interpreted as being due uniquely to single stellar evolution. We review classical binary phenomena, such as type Ia supernovae, and discuss new phenomena, such as intermediate luminosity transients, gravitational wave-producing double black holes, and the interaction between stars and their planets. Finally, we reassess well-known phenomena, such as luminous blue variables, in light of interpretations that include both single and binary stars. At the same time we contextualise the new discoveries within the framework of binary stellar evolution. The last decade has seen a revival in stellar astrophysics as the complexity of stellar observations is increasingly interpreted with an interplay of single and binary scenarios. The next decade, with the advent of massive projects such as the Square Kilometre Array, the James Webb Space Telescope, and increasingly sophisticated computational methods, will see the birth of an expanded framework of stellar evolution that will have repercussions in many other areas of astrophysics such as galactic evolution and nucleosynthesis.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We present the first extensive spectroscopic study of the global population in star clusters Trumpler 16, Trumpler 14, and Collinder 232 in the Carina nebula, using data from the Gaia-ESO Survey, down to solar-mass stars.  Methods: In addition to the standard homogeneous survey data reduction, a special processing was applied here because of the bright nebulosity surrounding Carina stars.  Results: We find about 400 good candidate members ranging from OB types down to slightly subsolar masses. About 100 heavily reddened early-type Carina members found here were previously unrecognized or poorly classified, including two candidate O stars and several candidate Herbig Ae/Be stars. Their large brightness makes them useful tracers of the obscured Carina population. The spectroscopically derived temperatures for nearly 300 low-mass members enables the inference of individual extinction values and the study of the relative placement of stars along the line of sight.  Conclusions: We find a complex spatial structure with definite clustering of low-mass members around the most massive stars and spatially variable extinction. By combining the new data with existing X-ray data, we obtain a more complete picture of the three-dimensional spatial structure of the Carina clusters and of their connection to bright and dark nebulosity and UV sources. The identification of tens of background giants also enables us to determine the total optical depth of the Carina nebula along many sightlines. We are also able to put constraints on the star formation history of the region with Trumpler 14 stars found to be systematically younger than stars in other subclusters. We find a large percentage of fast-rotating stars among Carina solar-mass members, which provide new constraints on the rotational evolution of pre-main-sequence stars in this mass range.

One avenue to achieve this is the identification and characterization of the main-sequence (MS) members of red supergiant (RSG) rich clusters.  Here, we utilize publicly available data from the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey. We show that point spread function photometry in conjunction with standard photometric decontamination techniques allows us to identify the most likely MS members in the 10-20 Myr old clusters RSGC 1-3. We confirm the previous detection of the MS in RSGC 2 and provide the first MS detection in RSGC 1 and RSGC 3. There are in excess of 100 stars with more than 8 M&sun; identified in each cluster. These MS members are concentrated towards the spectroscopically confirmed RSG stars. We utilize the J - K colours of the bright MS stars to determine the K-band extinction towards the clusters. The differential reddening is three times as large in the youngest cluster RSGC 1 as compared to the two older clusters RSGC 2 and RSGC 3. Spectroscopic follow-up of the cluster MS stars should lead to more precise distance and age estimates for these clusters as well as the determination of the stellar mass function in these high-mass environments.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram narrates their evolutionary history and directly assesses their properties. Placing stars in this diagram however requires the knowledge of their distances and interstellar extinctions, which are often poorly known for Galactic stars. The spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (sHRD) tells similar evolutionary tales, but is independent of distance and extinction measurements. Based on spectroscopically derived effective temperatures and gravities of almost 600 stars, we derive for the first time the observational distribution of Galactic massive stars in the sHRD. While biases and statistical limitations in the data prevent detailed quantitative conclusions at this time, we see several clear qualitative trends. By comparing the observational sHRD with different state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary predictions, we conclude that convective core overshooting may be mass-dependent and, at high mass (≳15 M&sun;), stronger than previously thought. Furthermore, we find evidence for an empirical upper limit in the sHRD for stars with Teff between 10 000 and 32 000 K and, a strikingly large number of objects below this line. This over-density may be due to inflation expanding envelopes in massive main-sequence stars near the Eddington limit.  Appendix A is available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

Using the photometric catalog of De Marchi et al., based on observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, and the most recent extinction law for this field, we identify 1035 bona fide pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars showing {{H}}alpha  excess emission at the 4sigma  level with an {{H}}alpha  equivalent width of 20 {\AA} or more. We find a wide spread in age spanning the range ~ 0.1{--}50 {Myr}. We also find that the older PMS objects are placed in front of the R136 cluster and are separated from it by a conspicuous amount of absorbing material, indicating that star formation has proceeded from the periphery into the interior of the region. We derive physical parameters for all PMS stars, including masses m, ages t, and mass accretion rates {\dot{M}}{acc}. To identify reliable correlations between these parameters, which are intertwined, we use a multivariate linear regression fit of the type {log}{\dot{M}}{acc}=a× {log}t+b× {log}m+c. The values of a and b for 30 Dor are compatible with those found in NGC 346 and NGC 602. We extend the fit to a uniform sample of 1307 PMS stars with 0.5< m/{M}o  < 1.5 and t< 16 {Myr} in six star-forming regions in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way with metallicities in the range of 0.1--1.0 {{Z}}o . We find a=-0.59+/- 0.02 and b=0.78+/- 0.08. The residuals are systematically different between the six regions and reveal a strong correlation with metallicity Z, of the type c=(-3.69+/- 0.02)-(0.30+/- 0.04)× {log}Z/{Z}o . A possible interpretation of this trend is that when the metallicity is higher so is the radiation pressure, and this limits the accretion process, in both its rate and duration.

	Abstract = {We present new interstellar dust models that have been derived by simultaneously fitting the far-ultraviolet to near-infrared extinction, the diffuse infrared (IR) emission and, unlike previous models, the elemental abundance constraints on the dust for different interstellar medium abundances, including solar, F and G star, and B star abundances. The fitting problem is a typical ill-posed inversion problem, in which the grain size distribution is the unknown, which we solve by using the method of regularization. The dust model contains various components: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), bare silicate, graphite, and amorphous carbon particles, as well as composite particles containing silicate, organic refractory material, water ice, and voids. The optical properties of these components were calculated using physical optical constants. As a special case, we reproduce the Li & Draine results; however, their model requires an excessive amount of silicon, magnesium, and iron to be locked up in dust: about 50 ppm (atoms per million of H atoms), significantly more than the upper limit imposed by solar abundances of these elements, about 34, 35, and 28 ppm, respectively. A major conclusion of this paper is that there is no unique interstellar dust model that simultaneously fits the observed extinction, diffuse IR emission, and abundance constraints. We find several classes of acceptable interstellar dust models that comply with these constraints. The first class is identical in composition to the Li & Draine model, consisting of PAHs, bare graphite and silicate grains, but with a different size distribution that is optimized to comply with the abundance constraints. The second class of models contains in addition to PAHs bare graphite and silicate grains also composite particles. Other classes contain amorphous carbon instead of graphite particles, or no carbon at all, except for that in PAHs. All classes are consistent with solar and F and G star abundances but have greater difficulty fitting the B star carbon abundance, which is better fitted with the latter (no carbon) models. Additional observational constraints, such as the interstellar polarization, or X-ray scattering may be able to discriminate between the various interstellar dust models.},

It is found that various mixtures consisting of graphite, silicon carbide, enstatite, olivine, iron, and magnetite are acceptable, that all the acceptable mixtures contain spherical uncoated graphite particles, and that graphite is the main contributor to the 2160-A feature. The required particle-size distribution is shown to be quite broad, with approximately a power-law distribution, for all substances considered. The sizes for graphite are estimated to vary from about 0.005 to about 1 micron, and the observed uniformity of extinction over the sky is explained in terms of a rather uniform power-law exponent, which could have resulted from a stochastic process in grain formation},

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic study of the shape of the dust-extinction law between 1.0 and 2.2mum towards a set of nine ultracompact HII regions with AV>~ 15mag. We find some evidence that the reddening curve may tend to flatten at higher extinctions, but just over half of the sample has extinction consistent with or close to the average for the interstellar medium (ISM). There is no evidence of extinction curves significantly steeper than the standard law, even where water ice is present. Comparing the results to the predictions of a simple extinction model, we suggest that a standard extinction law implies a robust upper limit to the grain-size distribution at around 0.1-0.3mum. Flatter curves are most likely the result of changes in this upper limit, although the effects of flattening as a result of unresolved clumpy extinction cannot be ruled out.},

	Abstract = {Context. The evolution of amorphous hydrocarbon materials, a-C(:H), principally resulting from ultraviolet (UV) photon absorption-induced processing, are likely at the heart of the variations in the observed properties of dust in the interstellar medium.  Aims: The consequences of the size-dependent and compositional variations in a-C(:H), from aliphatic-rich a-C:H to aromatic-rich a-C, are studied within the context of the interstellar dust extinction and emission.  Methods: Newly-derived optical property data for a-C(:H) materials, combined with that for an amorphous forsterite-type silicate with iron nano-particle inclusions, a-SilFe, are used to explore dust evolution in the interstellar medium.  Results: We present a new dust model that consists of a power-law distribution of small a-C grains and log-normal distributions of large a-SilFe and a-C(:H) grains. The model, which is firmly anchored by laboratory-data, is shown to quite naturally explain the variations in the infrared (IR) to far-ultraviolet (FUV) extinction, the 217 nm UV bump, the IR absorption and emission bands and the IR-mm dust emission.  Conclusions: The major strengths of the new model are its inherent simplicity and built-in capacity to follow dust evolution in interstellar media. We show that mantle accretion in molecular clouds and UV photo-processing in photo-dominated regions are likely the major drivers of dust evolution.},

@article{Mathis:1981wj,
	Abstract = {The effects of changing the upper and lower size limits of a distribution of bare graphite and silicate particles with n(a)alphaa-q is investigated. Mathis, Rumpl, and Nordsieck showed that the normal extinction is matched very well by having the small-size cutoff, a-, ≈ 0.005 or 0.01 mum, and the large size, a+, about 0.25 mum, and q = 3.5 for both substances. We consider the progressively peculiar extinctions exhibited by the well-observed stars, sigma Sco, rho Oph, and theta1 Ori C, with values of RV[≡ AV/E(B-V)] of 3.4, 4.4, and 5.5 compared to the normal 3.1. Two (sigma Sco, rho Oph) are in a neutral dense cloud; theta1 Ori C is in the Orion Nebula. We find that sigma Sco has a normal graphite distribution but has had its small silicate particles removed, so that a- (sil) ≈ 0.04 mum if q = 3.5, or q(sil) = 2.6 if the size limits are fixed. However, the upper size limit on silicates remains normal. In rho Oph, the graphite is still normal, but both a- (sil) and a+ (sil) are increased, to about 0.04 mum and 0.4 or 0.5 mum, respectively, if q = 3.5, or q(sil) ≈ 1.3 if the size limits are fixed. In theta1 Ori, the small limit on graphite has increased to about 0.04 mum, or q(gra) ≈ 3, while the silicates are about like those in rho Oph. The calculated lambda2175 bump is broader than the observed, but normal foreground extinction probably contributes appreciably to the observed bump. The absolute amount of extinction per H atom for rho Oph is not explained. The column density of H is so large that systematic effects might be present. Very large graphite particles (a > 3 mum) are required to "hide" the graphite without overly affecting the visual extinction, but a normal (small) graphite size distribution is required by the lambda2175 bump. We feel that it is unlikely that such a bimodal distribution exists.  The infrared color ratio (I - L)/(B - V) is also calculated and found to be in satisfactory agreement with observations for both normal extinction and for that in the rho Oph cloud. There are no free parameters in the size distribution to fit the infrared observations, but there is considerable uncertainty and rapid variation in the indices of refraction. However, the same indices which give good agreement with the normal interstellar medium when used with a normal size distribution give agreement for the rho Oph cloud when used with the size distribution needed to fit the ultraviolet there. This comparison is more free from uncertainties in the refractive indices than is either calculation alone. The ratio AV/tau (9.7 mum) is calculated to be 14, in agreement with observation.  The paper concludes with a summary of properties of interstellar dust which the graphite-silicate mixture fits.},

	Abstract = {We present a quantitative model for the infrared emission from dust in the diffuse interstellar medium. The model consists of a mixture of amorphous silicate grains and carbonaceous grains, each with a wide size distribution ranging from molecules containing tens of atoms to large grains >~1 mum in diameter. We assume that the carbonaceous grains have properties like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at very small sizes and graphitic properties for radii a>~50 {\AA}. On the basis of recent laboratory studies and guided by astronomical observations, we propose ``astronomical'' absorption cross sections for use in modeling neutral and ionized PAHs from the far-ultraviolet to the far-infrared. We also propose modifications to the far-infrared emissivity of ``astronomical silicate.'' We calculate energy distribution functions for small grains undergoing ``temperature spikes'' caused by stochastic absorption of starlight photons using realistic heat capacities and optical properties. Using a grain-size distribution consistent with the observed interstellar extinction, we are able to reproduce the near-IR to submillimeter emission spectrum of the diffuse interstellar medium, including the PAH emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 mum. The model is compared with the observed emission at high Galactic latitudes as well as in the Galactic plane, as measured by the COBE/DIRBE, COBE/FIRAS, IRTS/MIRS, and IRTS/NIRS instruments. The model has 60×10-6 of C (relative to H) locked up in PAHs, with 45×10-6 of C in a component peaking at ~6 {\AA} (NC~100 carbon atoms) to account for the PAH emission features and with 15×10-6 of C in a component peaking at ~50 {\AA} to account for the 60 mum flux. The total infrared emission is in excellent agreement with COBE/DIRBE observations at high Galactic latitudes, just as the albedo for our grain model is in accord with observations of the diffuse Galactic light. The aromatic absorption features at 3.3 and 6.2 mum predicted by our dust model are consistent with observations. We calculate infrared emission spectra for our dust model heated by a range of starlight intensities, from 0.3 to 104 times the local interstellar radiation field, and we tabulate the intensities integrated over the SIRTF/IRAC and MIPS bands. We also provide dust opacities tabulated from the extreme-ultraviolet to submillimeter wavelengths.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we compare the mass function slopes of Galactic globular clusters recently determined by Sollima & Baumgardt with a set of dedicated N-body simulations of star clusters containing between 65 000 and 200 000 stars. We study clusters starting with a range of initial mass functions (IMFs), black hole retention fractions and orbital parameters in the parent galaxy. We find that the present-day mass functions of globular clusters agree well with those expected for star clusters starting with Kroupa or Chabrier IMFs, and are incompatible with clusters starting with single power-law mass functions for the low-mass stars. The amount of mass segregation seen in the globular clusters studied by Sollima & Baumgardt can be fully explained by two-body relaxation driven mass segregation from initially unsegregated star clusters. Based on the present-day global mass functions, we expect that a typical globular cluster in our sample has lost about 75 per cent of its mass since formation, while the most evolved clusters have already lost more than 90 per cent of their initial mass and should dissolve within the next 1-2 Gyr. Most clusters studied by Sollima & Baumgardt also show a large difference between their central and global mass function (MF) slopes, implying that the majority of Galactic globular clusters are either near or already past core collapse. The strong mass segregation seen in most clusters also implies that only a small fraction of all black holes formed in globular clusters still reside in them.},

	Abstract = {We study the young S-stars within a distance of 0.04 pc from the supermassive black hole in the center of our Galaxy. Given how inhospitable the region is for star formation, their presence is more puzzling the younger we estimate their ages. In this study, we analyse the result of 12 years of high resolution spectroscopy within the central arcsecond of the Galactic Center (GC). By co-adding between 55 and 105 hours of spectra we have obtained high signal to noise H- and K-band spectra of eight stars orbiting the central supermassive black hole. Using deep H-band spectra, we show that these stars must be high surface gravity (dwarf) stars. We compare these deep spectra to detailed model atmospheres and stellar evolution models to infer the stellar parameters. Our analysis reveals an effective temperature of 21000-28500 K, a rotational velocity of 60-170 km/s, and a surface gravity of 4.1-4.2. These parameters imply a spectral type of B0-B3V for these stars. The inferred masses lie within 8-14 Msun. We derive an age of 6.6^{+3.4}{-4.7} Myr for the star S2, which is compatible with the age of the clockwise rotating young stellar disk in the GC. We estimate the age of all other studied S-stars to be less than 15 Myr, which are compatible with the age of S2 within the uncertainties. The relatively low ages for these S-stars favor a scenario in which the stars formed in a local disk rather than the field-binary-disruption scenario throughout a longer period of time.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Fundamental parameters of a sample of 26 apparently slowly-rotating single early B-type stars in OB associations and in the field within a distance of ≲400 pc from the Sun are presented and compared to high-precision data from detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs). Together with surface abundances for light elements the data are used to discuss the evolutionary status of the stars in context of the most recent Geneva grid of models for core hydrogen-burning stars in the mass-range ~6 to 18 M&sun; at metallicity Z = 0.014.  Methods: The fundamental parameters are derived on the basis of accurate and precise atmospheric parameters determined earlier by us from non-LTE analyses of high-quality spectra of the sample stars, utilising the new Geneva stellar evolution models.  Results: Evolutionary masses plus radii and luminosities are determined to better than typically 5%, 10%, and 20% uncertainty, respectively, facilitating the mass-radius and mass-luminosity relationships to be recovered for single core hydrogen-burning objects with a similar precision as derived from DEBs. Good agreement between evolutionary and spectroscopic masses is found. Absolute visual and bolometric magnitudes are derived to typically ~0.15-0.20 mag uncertainty. Metallicities are constrained to better than 15-20% uncertainty and tight constraints on evolutionary ages of the stars are provided. Overall, the spectroscopic distances and ages of individual sample stars agree with independently derived values for the host OB associations. Signatures of mixing with CN-cycled material are found in 1/3 of the sample stars. Typically, these are consistent with the amount predicted by the new Geneva models with rotation. The presence of magnetic fields appears to augment the mixing efficiency. In addition, a few objects are possibly the product of binary evolution. In particular, the unusual characteristics of tau Sco point to a blue straggler nature, due to a binary merger.  Conclusions: The accuracy and precision achieved in the determination of fundamental stellar parameters from the quantitative spectroscopy of single early B-type stars comes close (within a factor 2-4) to data derived from DEBs. While our fundamental parameters are in good agreement with those derived from DEBs as a function of spectral type, significant systematic differences with data from the astrophysical reference literature are found. Masses are ~10-20% and radii ~25% lower then the recommended values for luminosity class V, resulting in the stars being systematically fainter than assumed usually, by ~0.5 mag in absolute visual and bolometric magnitude. Our sample of giants is too small to derive firm conclusions, but similar trends as for the dwarfs are indicated.

	Abstract = {Context. Early B-type stars are invaluable indicators of elemental abundances of their birth environments. In contrast to the surrounding neutral interstellar matter (ISM) and H ii regions, their chemical composition is unaffected by depletion onto dust grains and the derivation of different abundances from recombination and collisional lines. In combination with ISM or nebular gas-phase abundances, they facilitate the otherwise inaccessible dust-phase composition to be constrained.  Aims: We determine precise abundances of C, N, Mg, Ne, and Fe in early B-type stars in the Orion star-forming region to: a) review previous determinations using a self-consistent quantitative spectral analysis based on modern stellar atmospheres and recently updated model atoms; b) complement our previous results for oxygen and silicon; and c) establish an accurate and reliable set of stellar metal abundances to constrain the dust-phase composition of the Orion H ii region.  Methods: A detailed, self-consistent spectroscopic study of a sample of 13 narrow-lined B0 V-B2 V stars in Ori OB1 is performed. High-quality spectra obtained with FIES at the NOT are analysed using both a hybrid non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) method (i.e., classical line-blanketed LTE model atmospheres and non-LTE line formation) and line-profile fitting techniques, validating the approach by comparison with previous results obtained using line-blanketed non-LTE model atmospheres and a curve-of-growth analysis.  Results: The two independent analysis strategies provide consistent results for basic stellar parameters and the abundances of oxygen and silicon. The extended analysis to C, N, Mg, Ne, and Fe finds a high degree of chemical homogeneity, with the 1sigma-scatter typically being 0.03-0.07 dex around the mean for the various elements. The present-day abundances of B-type stars in Ori OB1 are compatible at similar precision with cosmic abundance standard values as recently established from early-type stars in the solar neighbourhood and also with the Sun.

	Abstract = {Aims: We seek to constrain the formation of the Galactic bulge by analysing the detailed chemical composition of a large sample of red clump stars in Baade's window. These stars were selected to minimise the contamination by other Galactic components, so they are good tracers of the bulge metallicity distribution in Baade's window, at least for stars more metal-rich than ~-1.5.  Methods: We used an automatic procedure to measure [Fe/H] differentially with respect to the metal-rich star muLeo in a sample of 219 bulge red clump stars from R = 20 000 resolution spectra obtained with FLAMES/GIRAFFE at the VLT. For a subsample of 162 stars, we also derived [Mg/H] from spectral synthesis around the Mg i triplet at lambda 6319 {\AA}.  Results: The Fe and Mg metallicity distributions are both asymmetric with median values of +0.16 and +0.21, respectively. They show only a small proportion of stars at low metallicities, extending down to [Fe/H] = -1.1 or [Mg/H] = -0.7. The iron distribution is clearly bimodal, as revealed both by a deconvolution (from observational errors) and a Gaussian decomposition. The decomposition of the observed Fe and Mg metallicity distributions into Gaussian components yields two populations of equal sizes (50% each): a metal-poor component centred on [Fe/H] = -0.30 and [Mg/H] = -0.06 with a large dispersion and a narrow metal-rich component centred on [Fe/H] = +0.32 and [Mg/H] = +0.35. The metal-poor component shows high [Mg/Fe] ratios (around 0.3), while stars in the metal-rich component are found to have nearly solar ratios. Kinematical differences between the two components have also been found: the metal-poor component shows kinematics compatible with an old spheroid, while the metal-rich component is consistent with a population supporting a bar. In view of their chemical and kinematical properties, we suggest different formation scenarii for the two populations: a rapid formation time scale as an old spheroid for the metal-poor component (old bulge) and for the metal-rich component, a formation on a longer time scale driven by the evolution of the bar (pseudo-bulge). The observations are described well by a simple model consisting of two components: a simple closed box model to predict the metal-poor population contribution and a local thin disc metallicity distribution, shifted in metallicity, to represent the metal-rich population. The pseudo-bulge is compatible with its being formed from the inner thin disc, assuming high (but plausible) values of the gradients in the early Galactic disc.

	Abstract = {Based on high-resolution spectra obtained during gravitational microlensing events we present a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 32 dwarf and subgiant stars in the Galactic bulge. Combined with the sample of 26 stars from the previous papers in this series, we now have 58 microlensed bulge dwarfs and subgiants that have been homogeneously analysed. The main characteristics of the sample and the findings that can be drawn are: (i) the metallicity distribution (MDF) is wide and spans all metallicities between [Fe/H] = -1.9 to +0.6; (ii) the dip in the MDF around solar metallicity that was apparent in our previous analysis of a smaller sample (26 microlensed stars) is no longer evident; instead it has a complex structure and indications of multiple components are starting to emerge. A tentative interpretation is that there could be different stellar populations at interplay, each with a different scale height: the thin disk, the thick disk, and a bar population; (iii) the stars with [Fe/H] ≲ -0.1 are old with ages between 10 and 12 Gyr; (iv) the metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] ≳ -0.1 show a wide variety of ages, ranging from 2 to 12 Gyr with a distribution that has a dominant peak around 4-5 Gyr and a tail towards higher ages; (v) there are indications in the [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends that the "knee" occurs around [Fe/H] = -0.3to -0.2, which is a slightly higher metallicity as compared to the "knee" for the local thick disk. This suggests that the chemical enrichment of the metal-poor bulge has been somewhat faster than what is observed for the local thick disk. The results from the microlensed bulge dwarf stars in combination with other findings in the literature, in particular the evidence that the bulge has cylindrical rotation, indicate that the Milky Way could be an almost pure disk galaxy. The bulge would then just be a conglomerate of the other Galactic stellar populations (thin disk, thick disk, halo, and ...?), residing together in the central parts of the Galaxy, influenced by the Galactic bar.

	Abstract = {Context. Baade's window (BW) is one of the most observed Galactic bulge fields in terms of chemical abundances. Owing to its low and homogeneous interstellar absorption it is considered the perfect calibration field for Galactic bulge studies.  Aims: In the era of large spectroscopic surveys, calibration fields such as BW are necessary for cross calibrating the stellar parameters and individual abundances of the APOGEE survey.  Methods: We use the APOGEE BW stars to derive the metallicity distribution function (MDF) and individual abundances for alpha- and iron-peak elements of the APOGEE ASPCAP pipeline (DR13), as well as the age distribution for stars in BW.  Results: We determine the MDF of APOGEE stars in BW and find a remarkable agreement with that of the Gaia-ESO survey (GES). Both exhibit a clear bimodal distribution. We also find that the Mg-metallicity planes of the two surveys agree well, except for the metal-rich part ([Fe/H] > 0.1), where APOGEE finds systematically higher Mg abundances with respect to the GES. The ages based on the [C/N] ratio reveal a bimodal age distribution, with a major old population at   10 Gyr, with a decreasing tail towards younger stars. A comparison of stellar parameters determined by APOGEE and those determined by other sources reveals detectable systematic offsets, in particular for spectroscopic surface gravity estimates. In general, we find a good agreement between individual abundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni from APOGEE with that of literature values.  Conclusions: We have shown that in general APOGEE data show a good agreement in terms of MDF and individual chemical abundances with respect to literature works. Using the [C/N] ratio we found a significant fraction of young stars in BW.},

	Abstract = {Aiming at deriving a statistically well-justified Galactic Center distance, R 0, and reducing any occurrence of publication bias, we compiled the most comprehensive and most complete database of Galactic Center distances available to date, containing 273 new or revised R 0 estimates published since records began in 1918 October until 2016 June. We separate our R 0 compilation into direct and indirect distance measurements. The latter include a large body of estimates that rely on centroid determinations for a range of tracer populations, as well as measurements based on kinematic observations of objects at the solar circle, combined with a mass and/or rotational model of the Milky Way. Careful assessment of the Galactic Center distances resulting from orbital modeling and statistical parallax measurements in the Galactic nucleus yields our final Galactic Center distance recommendation of {R}0=8.3+/- 0.2 {{(statistical)}}+/- 0.4 {{(systematic)}} {kpc}. The centroid-based distances are in good agreement with this recommendation. Neither the direct measurements nor the post-1990 centroid-based distance determinations suggest that publication bias may be important. The kinematics-based distance estimates are affected by significantly larger uncertainties, but they can be used to constrain the Galaxy's rotation velocity at the solar galactocentric distance, {{{\Theta }}}0. Our results imply that the International-Astronomical-Union-recommended Galactic Center distance ({R}0{IAU}=8.5 {kpc}) needs a downward adjustment, while its {{{\Theta }}}0 recommendation ({{{\Theta }}}0=220 km s-1) requires a substantial upward revision.},

	Abstract = {We present moderate-resolution (lambda/Deltalambda=1300-4800) K-band spectra of more than 110 M giants in Galactic bulge fields interior to -4$\,^{\circ}$ (560 pc) and as close as within 0.2d (28 pc) of the Galactic center. From the equivalent widths of three features in these spectra, EW(Na), EW(Ca), and EW(CO) we calculate metallicities for the stars with a new calibration derived by Stephens et al. from globular clusters. The mean metallicity for each field is in good agreement with the recent results from Frogel et al. based on the slope of the giant branch method. We find no evidence for a metallicity gradient along the minor or major axes of the inner bulge (R<560 pc). The lack of a metallicity gradient in the inner bulge is not predicted by a theoretical model developed by Moll{\'a} et al. for a bulge formed by dissipative collapse. A metallicity gradient along the minor axis found by Frogel et al. only arises when fields located at larger galactic radius are included. However, these more distant fields are located outside of the infrared bulge defined by the COBE/DIRBE observations. We compute the metallicity distribution for the inner bulge and find a mean value of -0.21 dex with a dispersion of +/-0.30 dex, close to the values found in 1996 by Sadler et al. for Baade's window. Unlike the absence of a gradient, these values are close to theoretical predictions for a bulge formed by dissipative collapse.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We investigate the large-scale metallicity distribution in the Galactic bulge using large spatial coverage to constrain the bulge formation scenario.  Methods: We use the VISTA variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey data and 2MASS photometry, which cover 320 sqdeg of the Galactic bulge, to derive photometric metallicities by interpolating the (J - Ks)0 colors of individual red giant branch stars based on a set of globular cluster ridge lines. We then use this information to construct the first global metallicity map of the bulge with a resolution of 30' × 45'.  Results: The metallicity map of the bulge revealed a clear vertical metallicity gradient of ~0.04 dex/deg (~0.28 dex/kpc), with metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] ~ 0) dominating the inner bulge in regions closer to the Galactic plane (|b| < 5). At larger scale heights, the mean metallicity of the bulge population becomes significantly more metal poor.  Conclusions: This fits in the scenario of a boxy bulge originating from the vertical instability of the Galactic bar, formed early via secular evolution of a two-component stellar disk. Older metal-poor stars dominate at higher scale heights due to the non-mixed orbits of originally hotter thick disk stars.

	Abstract = {We present the first on-orbit observations to characterize the photometric performance of the in- frared (IR) camera on WFC3, based on data collected during the Servicing Mission Orbital Ver- ification 4 Phase (SMOV4) shortly after the installation of the WFC3 instrument on HST. The photometric zero points and stability of the detector are measured in all 15 IR filters, using two different HST spectrophotometric standards; the hot white dwarf star GD 153 and the cooler solar analog P330E. The measured counts of these stars are calculated from dithered, high signal-to-noise imaging observations. We find that the total system throughput of WFC3/IR is better than expected from the Thermal Vacuum (TV3) testing campaign, exhibiting efficiency gains of ~10 - 15% at all wavelengths. Repeat observations in all 15 filters are obtained at time intervals of 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month, and demonstrate that the throughput is stable to <1% in the medium and wide band filters. We update the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) with these preliminary results by fitting a smooth curve (3rd order polynomial) to the ratios of the efficiency gains over previous predictions, in the medium and wide band filters. This polynomial is multiplied into the SYNPHOT throughput routines. We calculate photometric zero points for the IR camera, factoring in the new on-orbit sensitivity measurements, in three photometric systems, STMAG, ABMAG, and VEGAMAG. A much more detailed Cycle 17 calibration plan, including observations targeting additional primary standards, begins in October 2009.},

	Abstract = {Aims.This paper develops a method for obtaining the star formation histories of a mixed, resolved population through the use of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The method provides insight into the local star formation rate, analyzing the observations of the Hipparcos satellite through a comparison with synthetic CMDs computed for different histories with an updated stellar evolution library. Methods: .Parallax and photometric uncertainties are included explicitly and corrected using the Bayesian Richardson-Lucy algorithm. We first describe our verification studies using artificial data sets. From this sensitivity study, the critical factors determining the success of a recovery for a known star formation rate are a partial knowledge of the IMF and the age-metallicity relation, and sample contamination by clusters and moving groups (special populations whose histories are different than that of the whole sample). Unresolved binaries are less important impediments. We highlight how these limit the method. Results: .For the real field sample, complete to MV < 3.5, we find that the solar neighborhood star formation rate has a characteristic timescale for variation of about 6 Gyr, with a maximum activity close to 3 Gyr ago. The similarity of this finding with column integrated star formation rates may indicate a global origin, possibly a collision with a satellite galaxy. We also discuss applications of this technique to general photometric surveys of other complex systems (e.g. Local Group dwarf galaxies) where the distances are well known.},

	Abstract = {The star formation history in the solar neighborhood is inferred by comparing a sample of field stars from the Hipparcos catalog with synthetic color-magnitude diagrams. We consider separately the main sequence and the red giant region of the H-R diagram. The criteria for our best solutions are based on the chi2 minimization of star distributions in selected zones of the H-R diagram. Our analysis suggests (1) that the solutions are compatible with a Salpeter initial mass function and with a star formation rate increasing in a broad sense from the beginning to the present time, (2) that the deduced volume-mass densities and the corresponding absolute scale of the star formation rate solutions are strongly influenced by the initial mass function slope of low-mass stars (below 0.5 Msolar), and (3) that the stellar evolutionary models are not completely adequate: in fact the theoretical ratio between the He-burning and MS star numbers is always a factor of 1.5 greater than the observational value. This fact could indicate the need for a more efficient overshoot in the evolutionary models or a different mixing theory.},

	Abstract = {Context: A new reduction of the astrometric data as produced by the Hipparcos mission has been published, claiming accuracies for nearly all stars brighter than magnitude Hp=8 to be better, by up to a factor 4, than in the original catalogue.  Aims: The new Hipparcos astrometric catalogue is checked for the quality of the data and the consistency of the formal errors as well as the possible presence of error correlations. The differences with the earlier publication are explained.  Methods: The internal errors are followed through the reduction process, and the external errors are investigated on the basis of a comparison with radio observations of a small selection of stars, and the distribution of negative parallaxes. Error correlation levels are investigated and the reduction by more than a factor 10 as obtained in the new catalogue is explained.  Results: The formal errors on the parallaxes for the new catalogue are confirmed. The presence of a small amount of additional noise, though unlikely, cannot be ruled out. Conclusions: The new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data provides an improvement by a factor 2.2 in the total weight compared to the catalogue published in 1997, and provides much improved data for a wide range of studies on stellar luminosities and local galactic kinematics.},

	Abstract = {Context: Over the past decade the use of the red clump (RC) as distance indicator has increased in importance as this evolutionary phase is well populated and a good local calibration exists.  Aims: The absolute calibration of the RC in the I and K band is investigated again based on the recently published revised Hipparcos parallaxes.  Methods: A numerical model is developed that takes the various selection criteria and the properties of the Hipparcos catalogue into account. The biases involved in applying certain selections are estimated with this model. Results: The absolute magnitudes that are found are MI = -0.22 $\pm$ 0.03 and MK = -1.54 $\pm$ 0.04 (on the 2MASS system). The I-band value is in good agreement with previous determinations, the K-band value is fainter than previously quoted, and this seems to be related to a selection bias whereby accurate K-magnitudes are only available for relatively few bright stars. Applying population corrections to the absolute K magnitude of RC stars in clusters supports the fainter magnitude scale.},

	Abstract = {On the basis of the near-infrared observations of bulge red clump stars near the Galactic center, we have determined the galactocentric distance to be R0=7.52+/-0.10 (stat) +/-0.35 (sys) kpc. We observed the red clump stars at |l|<~1.0d and 0.7d<~|b|<~1.0d with the IRSF 1.4 m telescope and the SIRIUS camera in the H and KS bands. After extinction and population corrections, we obtained (m-M)0=14.38+/-0.03 (stat) +/- 0.10 (sys). The statistical error is dominated by the uncertainty of the intrinsic local red clump stars' luminosity. The systematic error is estimated to be +/-0.10, including uncertainties in extinction and population correction, zero point of photometry, and the fitting of the luminosity function of the red clump stars. Our result, R0=7.52 kpc, is in excellent agreement with the distance determined geometrically with the star orbiting the massive black hole in the Galactic center. The recent result based on the spatial distribution of globular clusters is also consistent with our result. In addition, our study exhibits that the distance determination to the Galactic center with the red clump stars, even if the error of the population correction is taken into account, can achieve an uncertainty of about 5%, which is almost the same level as that in recent geometrical determinations.},

	Abstract = {The average near-infrared (K-band) luminosity of 238 Hipparcos red clump giants is derived and then used to measure the distance to the Galactic center. These Hipparcos red clump giants have been previously employed as I-band standard candles. The advantage of the K-band is a decreased sensitivity to reddening and perhaps a reduced systematic dependence on metallicity. In order to investigate the latter, and also to refer our calibration to a known metallicity zero point, we restrict our sample of red clump calibrators to those with abundances derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data. The mean metallicity of the sample is [Fe/H]=-0.18 dex (sigma=0.17 dex). The data are consistent with no correlation between MK and [Fe/H] and only weakly constrain the slope of this relation. The luminosity function of the sample peaks at MK=-1.61+/-0.03 mag. Next, we assemble published optical and near-infrared photometry for ~20 red clump giants in a Baade's window field with a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.17+/-0.09 dex, which is nearly identical to that of the Hipparcos red clump. Assuming that the average (V-I)0 and (V-K)0 colors of these two red clumps are the same, the extinctions in the Baade's window field are found to be AV=1.56, AI=0.87, and AK=0.15, in agreement with previous estimates. We derive the distance to the Galactic center: (m-M)0=14.58+/-0.11 mag, or R=8.24+/-0.42 kpc. The uncertainty in this distance measurement is dominated by the small number of Baade's window red clump giants examined here.},

Ks versus H-Ks color-magnitude diagrams reveal a well-defined population of red clump stars whose apparent magnitude peak changes continuously along the Galactic plane, from Ks=13.4 at l=-10deg to Ks=12.2 at l=10deg after dereddening. This variation can be explained by the barlike structure found in previous studies, but we find an additional inner structure at |l|<~4deg, where the longitude-apparent magnitude relation is distinct from the outer bar and where the apparent magnitude peak changes by only ~0.1 mag over the central 8$\,^{\circ}$. The exact nature of this inner structure is as yet uncertain.},

@article{Monachesi:2011eu,
	Abstract = {We present the deepest optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD) to date of the local elliptical galaxy M32. We have obtained F435W and F555W photometries based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys/High-Resolution Channel images for a region 110'' from the center of M32 (F1) and a background field (F2) about 320'' away from M32 center. Due to the high resolution of our Nyquist-sampled images, the small photometric errors, and the depth of our data (the CMD of M32 goes as deep as F435W ~ 28.5 at 50% completeness level), we obtain the most detailed resolved photometric study of M32 yet. Deconvolution of HST images proves to be superior than other standard methods to derive stellar photometry on extremely crowded HST images, as its photometric errors are ~2× smaller than other methods tried. The location of the strong red clump in the CMD suggests a mean age between 8 and 10 Gyr for [Fe/H] = -0.2 dex in M32. We detect for the first time a red giant branch bump and an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) bump in M32 which, together with the red clump, allow us to constrain the age and metallicity of the dominant population in this region of M32. These features indicate that the mean age of M32's population at ~2' from its center is between 5 and 10 Gyr. We see evidence of an intermediate-age population in M32 mainly due to the presence of AGB stars rising to M F555W  ~ -2.0. Our detection of a blue component of stars (blue plume) may indicate for the first time the presence of a young stellar population, with ages of the order of 0.5 Gyr, in our M32 field. However, it is likely that the brighter stars of this blue plume belong to the disk of M31 rather than to M32. The fainter stars populating the blue plume indicate the presence of stars not younger than 1 Gyr and/or BSSs in M32. The CMD of M32 displays a wide color distribution of red giant branch stars indicating an intrinsic spread in metallicity with a peak at [Fe/H] ~ -0.2. There is not a noticeable presence of blue horizontal branch stars, suggesting that an ancient population with [Fe/H] < -1.3 does not significantly contribute to the light or mass of M32 in our observed fields. M32's dominant population of 8-10 Gyr implies a formation redshift of 1 <~ zf <~ 2, precisely when observations of the specific star formation rates and models of "downsizing" imply galaxies of M32's mass ought to be forming their stars. Our CMD therefore provides a "ground truth" of downsizing scenarios at z = 0. Our background field data represent the deepest optical observations yet of the inner disk and bulge of M31. Its CMD exhibits a broad color spread of red giant stars indicative of its metallicity range with a peak at [Fe/H] ~ -0.4 dex, slightly more metal-poor than M32 in our fields. The observed blue plume consists of stars as young as 0.3 Gyr, in agreement with previous works on the disk of M31. The detection of bright AGB stars reveals the presence of intermediate-age population in M31, which is, however, less significant than that in M32 at our field's location.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with GO proposal 10572.},

	Abstract = {We present the broadest and most precise empirical investigation of red giant branch bump (RGBB) brightness and number counts ever conducted. We implement a new method and use data from two Hubble Space Telescope globular cluster (GC) surveys to measure the brightness and star counts of the RGBB in 72 GCs. The median measurement precision is 0.018 mag in the brightness and 31% in the number counts, respectively, reaching peak precision values of 0.005 mag and 10%. The position of the main-sequence turnoff and the number of horizontal branch stars are used as comparisons where appropriate. Several independent scientific conclusions are newly possible with our parameterization of the RGBB. Both brightness and number counts are shown to have second parameters in addition to their strong dependence on metallicity. The RGBBs are found to be anomalous in the GCs NGC 2808, 5286, 6388, and 6441, likely due to the presence of multiple populations. Finally, we use our empirical calibration to predict the properties of the Galactic bulge RGBB. The updated RGBB properties for the bulge are shown to differ from the GC-calibrated prediction, with the former having lower number counts, a lower brightness dispersion, and a brighter peak luminosity than would be expected from the latter. This discrepancy is well explained by the Galactic bulge having a higher helium abundance than expected from GCs, DeltaY ~ +0.06 at the median metallicity.},

	Abstract = {We measure the red giant branch bump (RGBB) of the Galactic bulge, the most metal-rich RGBB ever detected. The RGBB luminosity function peaks at the expected brightness, but its number density is very low relative to Galactic globular cluster calibrations, implying the Galactic bulge has a higher helium enrichment parameter DeltaY/DeltaZ >= 4.0 for Y ~ 0.35 rather than the standard 2.0 with Y = 0.27, which we suggest may be a common feature of galactic spheroids. The RGBB is (0.71 $\pm$ 0.02) mag fainter than the red clump (RC) in I toward the densest stellar regions imaged by the OGLE-III Galactic bulge photometric survey, (|l| <= 4, 2 <~ |b| <= 4). The number density of RGBB stars is (12.7 $\pm$ 2.0)% that of RC stars. The brightness dispersion of the RGBB is significantly lower than that of the RC, a result that is difficult to explain as the RGBB luminosity is known to vary significantly with metallicity. Sight lines that have two RCs have two RGBBs with similar properties to one another, an expected outcome if the Milky Way's bulge is X-shaped. We also find preliminary evidence of the Galactic bulge asymptotic giant branch bump, at a brightness of ~1.06 mag brighter than the RC in I and with a number density ~1.5% that of the RC. Accounting for the RGBB has a small effect on the best-fit parameters of the RC, shifting its best-fit peak brightness and reducing its brightness dispersion by ~0.015 mag each.},

	Abstract = {We analyzed the distribution of the red clump (RC) stars throughout the Galactic bulge using Two Micron All Sky Survey data. We mapped the position of the RC in 1 deg2 fields within the area |l| <= 8fdg5 and 3fdg5 <= |b| <= 8fdg5, for a total of 170 deg2. The single RC seen in the central area splits into two components at high Galactic longitudes in both hemispheres, produced by two structures at different distances along the same line of sight. The X-shape is clearly visible in the Z-X plane for longitudes close to the l = 0$\,^{\circ}$ axis. Crude measurements of the space densities of RC stars in the bright and faint RC populations are consistent with the adopted RC distances, providing further supporting evidence that the X-structure is real, and that there is approximate front-back symmetry in our bulge fields. We conclude that the Milky Way bulge has an X-shaped structure within |l| <~ 2$\,^{\circ}$, seen almost edge-on with respect to the line of sight. Additional deep near-infrared photometry extending into the innermost bulge regions combined with spectroscopic data is needed in order to discriminate among the different possibilities that can cause the observed X-shaped structure.},

The fainter (hereafter "main") component is the one that more closely follows the distance-longitude relation of the bulge RC. The main component is ~0.5 mag fainter than the secondary component and with an overall approximately equal population. For sightlines further from the plane, the difference in brightness increases, and more stars are found in the secondary component than in the main component.

	Abstract = {The finding of a double red clump in the luminosity function of the Milky Way bulge has been interpreted as evidence for an X-shaped structure. Recently, an alternative explanation has been suggested, where the double red clump is an effect of multiple stellar populations in a classical spheroid. In this Letter we provide an observational assessment of this scenario and show that it is not consistent with the behaviour of the red clump across different lines of sight, particularly at high distances from the Galactic plane. Instead, we confirm that the shape of the red clump magnitude distribution closely follows the distance distribution expected for an X-shaped bulge at critical Galactic latitudes. We also emphasize some key observational properties of the bulge red clump that should not be neglected in the search for alternative scenarios.  Based on observations taken within the ESO VISTA Public Survey VVV, Programme ID 179.B-2002.},

	Abstract = {From Two Micron All Sky Survey infrared photometry, we find two red clump (RC) populations coexisting in fields toward the Galactic bulge at latitudes |b|>5fdg5, ranging over ~13$\,^{\circ}$ in longitude and 20$\,^{\circ}$ in latitude. These RC peaks indicate two stellar populations separated by ~2.3 kpc at (l, b) = (+1, - 8) the two RCs are located at 6.5 and 8.8 $\pm$ 0.2 kpc. The double-peaked RC is inconsistent with a tilted bar morphology. Most of our fields show the two RCs at roughly constant distance with longitude, also inconsistent with a tilted bar; however, an underlying bar may be present. Stellar densities in the two RCs change dramatically with longitude: on the positive longitude side the foreground RC is dominant, while the background RC dominates negative longitudes. A line connecting the maxima of the foreground and background populations is tilted to the line of sight by ~20$\,^{\circ}$$\pm$4$\,^{\circ}$, similar to claims for the tilt of a Galactic bar. The distance between the two RCs decreases toward the Galactic plane; seen edge-on the bulge is X-shaped, resembling some extragalactic bulges and the results of N-body simulations. The center of this X is consistent with the distance to the Galactic center, although better agreement would occur if the bulge is 2-3 Gyr younger than 47 Tuc. Our observations may be understood if the two RC populations emanate, nearly tangentially, from the Galactic bar ends, in a funnel shape. Alternatively, the X, or double funnel, may continue to the Galactic center. From the Sun, this would appear peanut/box shaped, but X-shaped when viewed tangentially.},

@article{Dougherty:2010gf,
	Abstract = {Aims: Current mass-loss rate estimates imply that main sequence line-driven winds are not sufficient to strip away the H-rich envelope to yield Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. The rich transitional population of the young massive cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1) provides an ideal laboratory to observe and constrain mass-loss processes throughout the transitional phase of stellar evolution.  Methods: We present an analysis of deep radio continuum observations of Wd 1 obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at four frequency bands that permit investigation of the intrinsic characteristics of the radio emission.  Results: We detect 18 cluster members, a sample dominated by the cool hypergiants, with additional detections amongst the hotter OB supergiants and WR stars. The radio properties of the sample are diverse, with thermal, non-thermal and composite thermal/non-thermal sources present. Mass-loss rates determined for stars with partially optically thick stellar winds are ~10-5 M&sun; yr-1 across all spectral types, insufficient to enable the formation of WRs during a massive star lifetime, and the stars must undergo a period of greatly enhanced mass loss. The sgB[e] star W9, the brightest radio source in Wd 1, may provide an example, with a current mass-loss rate an order of magnitude higher than the other cluster members, and an extended nebula interpreted as a wind from an earlier epoch with a density ~3× the current wind. Such an envelope structure in W9 is reminiscent of luminous blue variables, and one that shows evidence of two eras of high, possibly eruptive mass loss. Surprisingly, three of the OB supergiants are detected, implying unusually dense winds, though they are embedded in more extended emission regions that may influence the derived parameters. They also may have composite spectra, suggesting binarity, which can lead to a higher flux than expected from a stellar wind. Spatially resolved nebulae are associated with three of the four RSGs and three of the six YHGs in the cluster, which are due to quiescent mass loss rather than outbursts. The extended nebulae of W20 and W26 have a cometary morphology, implying significant interaction with either the intracluster medium or cluster wind. For some of the cool star winds, the ionizing source may be a companion star though the cluster radiation density is sufficiently high to provide the necessary ionizing radiation. Five WR stars are detected with composite spectra, interpreted as arising in colliding-wind binaries.},

We find an apparent spectral type of early-mid A from our data, in contrast to an earlier classification of B2I, made from data obtained in 1981. The concurrent development of a rich emission line spectrum suggests a very high mass loss rate; the continued presence of He I emission suggesting that the underlying star remains significantly hotter than implied by its apparent spectral type. We suggest that W243 is a Luminous Blue Variable undergoing an eruptive phase, leading to an extreme mass loss rate and the formation of a pseudo photosphere.

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of an X-ray pulsar in the young, massive Galactic star cluster Westerlund 1. We detected a coherent signal from the brightest X-ray source in the cluster, CXO J164710.2-455216, during two Chandra observations on 2005 May 22 and June 18. The period of the pulsar is 10.6107(1) s. We place an upper limit to the period derivative of P˙<2×10-10 s s-1, which implies that the spin-down luminosity is E˙<=3×1033 ergs s-1. The X-ray luminosity of the pulsar is LX~3+10-2×1033(D/5 kpc)2 ergs s-1, and the spectrum can be described by a kT=0.61+0.02-0.02 keV blackbody with a radius of Rbb=0.27+/-0.03(D/5 kpc) km. Deep infrared observations reveal no counterpart with K<18.5, which rules out a binary companion with M>1 Msolar. Taken together, the properties of the pulsar indicate that it is a magnetar. The rarity of slow X-ray pulsars and the position of CXO J164710.2-455216 only 1.6 arcmin from the core of Westerlund 1 indicates that it is a member of the cluster with >99.97% confidence. Westerlund 1 contains 07 V stars with initial masses Mi~35 Msolar and >50 post-main-sequence stars that indicate the cluster is 4+/-1 Myr old. Therefore, the progenitor to this pulsar had an initial mass Mi>40 Msolar. This is the most secure result among a handful of observational limits to the masses of the progenitors to neutron stars.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Massive stars are known to demonstrate significant spectroscopic and photometric variability over a wide range of timescales. However the physical mechanisms driving this behaviour remain poorly understood. Westerlund 1 presents an ideal laboratory for studying these processes in a rich, coeval population of post-main sequence stars and we present a pathfinding study aimed at characterising their variability.  Methods: To do this we utilised the large body of spectroscopic and photometric data that has accumulated for Wd1 during the past decade of intensive studies, supplemented with the sparser historical observations extending back to the early 1960s.  Results: Despite the heterogeneous nature of this dataset, we were able to identify both spectroscopic and photometric variability amongst every class of evolved massive star present within Wd 1. Spectroscopic variability attributable to both wind asphericity and photospheric pulsations was present amongst both the hot and cool hypergiants and the former, also with the Wolf Rayets. Given the limitations imposed by the data, we were unable to determine the physical origin of the wind structure inferred for the OB supergiants, noting that it was present in both single pulsating and binary stars. In contrast we suspect that the inhomogineities in the winds of the Wolf Rayets are driven by binary interactions and, conversely, by pulsations in at least one of the cool hypergiants. Photospheric pulsations were found for stars ranging from spectral types as early as O9 I through to the mid F Ia+ yellow hypergiants - with a possible dependence on the luminosity class amongst the hot supergiants. The spectroscopically variable red supergiants (M2-5 Ia) are also potential pulsators but require further observations to confirm this hypothesis. Given these findings it was therefore rather surprising that, with the exception of W243, no evidence of the characteristic excursions of both luminous blue variables and yellow hypergiants was found. Nevertheless, future determination of the amplitude and periodicity of these pulsations as a function of temperature, luminosity and evolutionary state holds out the tantalising possibility of constraining the nature of the physical mechanisms driving the instabilities that constrain and define stellar evolution in the upper reaches of the HR diagram. Relating to this, the lack of secular evolution amongst the cool hypergiants and the presence of both high-luminosity yellow hypergiants and red supergiants within Wd1 potentially place strong constraints on post-main sequence evolutionary pathways, with the latter result apparently contradicting current theoretical predictions for >25 M&sun; stars at solar metallicites.

We present magnitude transformations between various K-band filters as a function of color. Isochrones with extinction of up to 6 mag in the K band are also presented. As found for the filter pairs composed of H and K band filters, we find that the reddened isochrones of different filter pairs behave as if they follow different extinction laws, and that the extinction curves of Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS filter pairs in the color-magnitude diagram are considerably nonlinear. Because of these problems, extinction values estimated with NICMOS filters can be in error by up to 1.3 mag. Our calculation suggests that the extinction law implied by the observations of Rieke et al. for wavelengths between the J and K bands is better described by a power-law function with an exponent of 1.66 instead of 1.59, which is commonly used with an assumption that the transmission functions of J and K filters are Dirac delta functions.},

	Abstract = {We calculate theoretical isochrones in a consistent way for five filters (K, K', Ks, F205W, and F222M) in the atmospheric window between 1.9 and 2.5 mum using the Padova stellar evolutionary models by Girardi et al. Even when displayed in the same Vega magnitude system, the near-infrared colors of the same isochrone can differ by up to 0.18 mag at its bright end, depending on the filter. We present magnitude transformations between K-band filters as a function of color from H and K band filters. Isochrones with extinction at K of up to 6 mag are also presented. We find that care is needed when comparing extinction values that are estimated using different filter sets in the K band, in particular when comparing those of atmospheric and space filter sets: extinction values for space filters can be in error by up to 0.3 mag. To reduce this error, we introduce an ``effective extinction slope'' for each filter set and isochrone model, which describes the extinction behavior of isochrones in the color-magnitude diagram more correctly than the actual extinction law. Our calculation also suggests that the extinction law implied by the observations of Rieke et al. for wavelengths between the H and K bands is better described by a power-law function with an exponent of 1.61 instead of 1.55, which is commonly used with an assumption that the transmission functions of H and K filters are Dirac delta functions.},

	Abstract = {Context. Westerlund 1 is a young, massive Galactic starburst cluster that contains a rich coeval population of Wolf-Rayet stars, hot- and cool-phase transitional supergiants, and a magnetar.  Aims: We use spectroscopic and photometric observations of the eclipsing double-lined binary W13 to derive dynamical masses for the two components, in order to determine limits for the progenitor masses of the magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216 and the population of evolved stars in Wd1.  Methods: We use eleven epochs of high-resolution VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy to construct a radial velocity curve for W13. R-band photometry is used to constrain the inclination of the system.  Results: W13 has an orbital period of 9.2709 $\pm$ 0.0015 days and near-contact configuration. The shallow photometric eclipse rules out an inclination greater than 65$\,^{\circ}$, leading to lower limits for the masses of the emission-line optical primary and supergiant optical secondary of 21.4 $\pm$ 2.6 M_&sun; and 32.8 $\pm$ 4.0 M_&sun; respectively, rising to 23.2-3.0+3.3 M_&sun; and 35.4-4.6+5.0 M_&sun; for our best-fit inclination 62-4+3 degrees. Comparison with theoretical models of Wolf-Rayet binary evolution suggest the emission-line object had an initial mass in excess of ~35 M_&sun;, with the most likely model featuring highly non-conservative late-Case A/Case B mass transfer and an initial mass in excess of 40 M_&sun;.  Conclusions: This result confirms the high progenitor mass of the magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216 inferred from its membership in Wd1, and represents the first dynamical constraint on the progenitor mass of any magnetar. The red supergiants in Wd1 must have similar progenitor masses to W13 and are therefore amongst the most massive stars to undergo a red supergiant phase, representing a challenge for population models that suggest stars in this mass range end their redwards evolution as yellow hypergiants.  This work is based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under programme IDs ESO 81.D-0324 and 383.D-0633.},

	Abstract = {We present the near-infrared observations of population II Cepheids in the Galactic bulge from VVV survey. We identify 340 population II Cepheids in the Galactic bulge from VVV survey based on their match with OGLE-III Catalogue. The single-epoch $JH$ and multi-epoch $K_s$ observations complement the accurate periods and optical $(VI)$ mean-magnitudes from OGLE. The sample consisting of BL Herculis and W Virginis subtypes is used to derive period-luminosity relations after correcting mean-magnitudes for the extinction. Our $K_s$-band period-luminosity relation, $K_s = -2.189(0.056)~[\log(P) - 1] + 11.187(0.032)$, is consistent with published work for BL Herculis and W Virginis variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We present a combined OGLE-III and VVV catalogue with periods, classification, mean magnitudes and extinction for 264 Galactic bulge population II Cepheids having good-quality $K_s$-band light curves. The absolute magnitudes for population II Cepheids and RR Lyraes calibrated using Gaia and Hubble Space Telescope parallaxes, together with calibrated magnitudes for Large Magellanic Cloud population II Cepheids, are used to obtain a distance to the Galactic center, $R_0=8.34\pm0.03{\mathrm{(stat.)}}\pm0.41{\mathrm{(syst.)}}$, which changes by $^{+ 0.05}_{-0.25}$ with different extinction laws. While noting the limitation of small number statistics, we find that the present sample of population II Cepheids in the Galactic bulge shows a nearly spheroidal spatial distribution, similar to metal-poor RR Lyrae variables. We do not find evidence of the inclined bar as traced by the metal-rich red-clump stars. The number density for population II Cepheids is more limited as compared to abundant RR Lyraes but they are bright and exhibit a wide range in period that provides a robust period-luminosity relation for an accurate estimate of the distance to the Galactic center.},

	Abstract = {We construct a large set of dynamical models of the galactic bulge, bar and inner disc using the made-to-measure method. Our models are constrained to match the red clump giant density from a combination of the VVV, UKIDSS and 2MASS infrared surveys together with stellar kinematics in the bulge from the BRAVA and OGLE surveys, and in the entire bar region from the ARGOS Survey. We are able to recover the bar pattern speed and the stellar and dark matter mass distributions in the bar region, thus recovering the entire galactic effective potential. We find a bar pattern speed of 39.0 $\pm$ 3.5 km s- 1 kpc- 1, placing the bar corotation radius at 6.1 $\pm$ 0.5 kpc and making the Milky Way bar a typical fast rotator. We evaluate the stellar mass of the long bar and bulge structure to be Mbar/bulge = 1.88 $\pm$ 0.12 × 1010 M&sun;, larger than the mass of disc in the bar region, Minner disc = 1.29 $\pm$ 0.12 × 1010 M&sun;. The total dynamical mass in the bulge volume is 1.85 $\pm$ 0.05 × 1010 M&sun;. Thanks to more extended kinematic data sets and recent measurement of the bulge initial mass function, our models have a low dark matter fraction in the bulge of 17 $\pm$ 2 per cent. We find a dark matter density profile which flattens to a shallow cusp or core in the bulge region. Finally, we find dynamical evidence for an extra central mass of ˜ 0.2 × 1010 M&sun;, probably in a nuclear disc or discy pseudo-bulge.},

	Abstract = {Aims.The development of powerful infrared observational techniques enables the study of very extincted objects and young embedded star-forming regions. This is especially interesting in the context of massive stars that form and spend a non negligible fraction of their life still enshrouded in their parental molecular cloud. Spectrophotometric calibrations are thus necessary to constrain the physical properties of heavily extincted objects.  Methods: Here, we derive UBVJHK magnitudes and bolometric corrections from a grid of atmosphere models for O stars. Bessel passbands are used. Bolometric corrections (BC) are derived as a function of Teff and are subsequently used to derive BC -spectral type (ST) and absolute magnitudes- ST relations.  Results: Infrared magnitudes and, for the first time, bolometric corrections are given for the full range of spectral types and luminosity classes. Infrared colors are essentially constant, and (H-K)0 is 0.05 mag bluer than previously proposed. Optical calibrations are also provided and are similar to previous work, except for (B-V)0 which is found to be at minimum -0.28 for standard O stars, slightly higher (0.04 mag) than commonly accepted.  Conclusions: We present a consistent set of photometric calibrations of optical and infrared magnitudes and bolometric corrections for Galactic O stars as a function of Teff and spectral type based on non-LTE atmosphere models including winds and line-blanketing.},

	Abstract = {We construct size distributions for carbonaceous and silicate grain populations in different regions of the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC. The size distributions include sufficient very small carbonaceous grains (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules) to account for the observed infrared and microwave emission from the diffuse interstellar medium. Our distributions reproduce the observed extinction of starlight, which varies depending on the interstellar environment through which the light travels. As shown by Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis in 1989, these variations can be roughly parameterized by the ratio of visual extinction to reddening, RV. We adopt a fairly simple functional form for the size distribution, characterized by several parameters. We tabulate these parameters for various combinations of values for RV and bC, the C abundance in very small grains. We also find size distributions for the line of sight to HD 210121 and for sight lines in the LMC and SMC. For several size distributions, we evaluate the albedo and scattering asymmetry parameter and present model extinction curves extending beyond the Lyman limit.},

	Abstract = {We report on the structure of the nuclear star cluster in the innermost 0.16 pc of the Galaxy as measured by the number density profile of late-type giants. Using laser guide star adaptive optics in conjunction with the integral field spectrograph, OSIRIS, at the Keck II telescope, we are able to differentiate between the older, late-type (~ 1 Gyr) stars, which are presumed to be dynamically relaxed, and the unrelaxed young (~ 6 Myr) population. This distinction is crucial for testing models of stellar cusp formation in the vicinity of a black hole, as the models assume that the cusp stars are in dynamical equilibrium in the black hole potential. In the survey region, we classified 60 stars as early-type (22 newly identified) and 74 stars as late-type (61 newly identified). We find that contamination from young stars is significant, with more than twice as many young stars as old stars in our sensitivity range (K' < 15.5) within the central arcsecond. Based on the late-type stars alone, the surface stellar number density profile, Sigma(R) vprop R -Gamma, is flat, with Gamma = -0.27 $\pm$ 0.19. Monte Carlo simulations of the possible de-projected volume density profile, n(r) vpropr -gamma, show that gamma is less than 1.0 at the 99.7% confidence level. These results are consistent with the nuclear star cluster having no cusp, with a core profile that is significantly flatter than that predicted by most cusp formation theories, and even allows for the presence of a central hole in the stellar distribution. Of the possible dynamical interactions that can lead to the depletion of the red giants observable in this survey---stellar collisions, mass segregation from stellar remnants, or a recent merger event---mass segregation is the only one that can be ruled out as the dominant depletion mechanism. The lack of a stellar cusp around a supermassive black hole would have important implications for black hole growth models and inferences on the presence of a black hole based upon stellar distributions.},

	Abstract = {We use the timescale distribution of ~3000 microlensing events measured by the OGLE-III survey, together with accurate new made-to-measure dynamical models of the Galactic bulge/bar region, to measure the IMF in the inner Milky Way. The timescale of each event depends on the mass of the lensing object, together with the relative distances and velocities of the lens and source. The dynamical model provides statistically these distances and velocities allowing us to constrain the lens mass function, and from this to infer the IMF. Parameterising the IMF as a broken power-law, we find slopes in the main sequence $\alpha_{\rm ms}=1.31\pm0.10|_{\rm stat}\pm0.10|_{\rm sys}$ and brown dwarf region $\alpha_{\rm bd}=-0.7\pm0.9|_{\rm stat}\pm0.8|_{\rm sys}$ where we use a fiducial 50% binary fraction, and the systematic uncertainty covers the range of binary fractions 0-100%. Similarly for a log-normal IMF we conclude $M_c=(0.17\pm0.02|_{\rm stat}\pm0.01|_{\rm sys})M_\odot$ and $\sigma_m=0.49\pm0.07|_{\rm stat}\pm0.06|_{\rm sys}$. These values are very similar to a Kroupa or Chabrier IMF respectively, showing that the IMF in the bulge is indistinguishable from that measured locally, despite the lenses lying in the inner Milky Way where the stars are mostly ~10Gyr old and formed on a fast $\alpha$-element enhanced timescale. This therefore constrains models of IMF variation that depend on the properties of the collapsing gas cloud.},

	Abstract = {Recently, a deviation of the Gaia TGAS parallaxes from the asteroseismic ones for giants was found. We show that for parallaxes $\varpi<1.5$ mas it can be explained by a selection effect in favour of bright and luminous giants in the Tycho-2 and TGAS catalogues. Another explanation of this deviation seems to be valid for $\varpi>1.5$ mas based on the best extinction estimates: the deviation may be caused not by a bias of parallax, but by an underestimation of the extinction (and, consequently, an overestimation of the calculated absolute magnitude) in the asteroseismic results. We demonstrate that the reliable estimates of the reddening and extinction (about 0.22 mag of the visual extinction for the Kepler field) better fit both the giants and main sequence stars to the PARSEC, MIST and YaPSI isochrones.},

	Abstract = {Studies of the formation and evolution of young stars and their disks rely on the knowledge of the stellar parameters of the young stars. The derivation of these parameters is commonly based on comparison with photospheric template spectra. Furthermore, chromospheric emission in young active stars impacts the measurement of mass accretion rates, a key quantity to study disk evolution. Here we derive stellar properties of low-mass pre-main sequence stars without disks, which represent ideal photospheric templates for studies of young stars. We also use these spectra to constrain the impact of chromospheric emission on the measurements of mass accretion rates. The spectra in reduced, flux-calibrated, and corrected for telluric absorption form are made available to the community. We derive the spectral type for our targets by analyzing the photospheric molecular features present in their VLT/X-Shooter spectra by means of spectral indices and comparison of the relative strength of photospheric absorption features. We also measure effective temperature, gravity, projected rotational velocity, and radial velocity from our spectra by fitting them with synthetic spectra with the ROTFIT tool. The targets have negligible extinction and spectral type from G5 to M8. We perform synthetic photometry on the spectra to derive the typical colors of young stars in different filters. We measure the luminosity of the emission lines present in the spectra and estimate the noise due to chromospheric emission in the measurements of accretion luminosity in accreting stars. We provide a calibration of the photospheric colors of young PMS stars as a function of their spectral type in a set of standard broad-band optical and near-infrared filters. For stars with masses of ~ 1.5Msun and ages of ~1-5 Myr, the chromospheric noise converts to a limit of measurable mass accretion rates of ~ 3x10^-10 Msun/yr.},

	Abstract = {We use state-of-the-art chemical models to track the cosmic evolution of the CNO isotopes in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, yielding powerful constraints on their stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-assess the relative roles of massive stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and novae in the production of rare isotopes such as 13C, 15N, 17O and 18O, along with 12C, 14N and 16O. The CNO isotope yields of super-AGB stars, novae and fast-rotating massive stars are included. Having reproduced the available isotope enrichment data in the solar neighbourhood, and across the Galaxy, and having assessed the sensitivity of our models to the remaining uncertainties, e.g. nova yields and star-formation history, we show that we can meaningfully constrain the stellar IMF in galaxies using C, O and N isotope abundance ratios. In starburst galaxies, where data for multiple isotopologue lines are available, we find compelling new evidence for a top-heavy stellar IMF, with profound implications for their star-formation rates and efficiencies, perhaps also their stellar masses. Neither chemical fractionation nor selective photodissociation can significantly perturb globally-averaged isotopologue abundance ratios away from the corresponding isotope ones, as both these processes will typically affect only small mass fractions of molecular clouds in galaxies. Thus the Atacama Large Millimetre Array now stands ready to probe the stellar IMF, and even the ages of specific starburst events in star-forming galaxies across cosmic time unaffected by the dust obscuration effects that plague optical/near-infrared studies.},

@article{Yu:2017pi,
	Abstract = {We compare the existent methods, including the minimum spanning tree based method and the local stellar density based method, in measuring mass segregation of star clusters. We find that the minimum spanning tree method reflects more the compactness, which represents the global spatial distribution of massive stars, while the local stellar density method reflects more the crowdedness, which provides the local gravitational potential information. It is suggested to measure the local and the global mass segregation simultaneously. We also develop a hybrid method that takes both aspects into account. This hybrid method balances the local and the global mass segregation in the sense that the predominant one is either caused by dynamical evolution or purely accidental, especially when such information is unknown a priori. In addition, we test our prescriptions with numerical models and show the impact of binaries in estimating the mass segregation value. As an application, we use these methods on the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) observations and the Taurus cluster. We find that the ONC is significantly mass segregated down to the 20th most massive stars. In contrast, the massive stars of the Taurus cluster are sparsely distributed in many different subclusters, showing a low degree of compactness. The massive stars of Taurus are also found to be distributed in the high-density region of the subclusters, showing significant mass segregation at subcluster scales. Meanwhile, we also apply these methods to discuss the possible mechanisms of the dynamical evolution of the simulated substructured star clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present constraints on variations in the initial mass function (IMF) of nine local early-type galaxies based on their low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) populations. Comprised of accreting black holes and neutron stars, these LMXBs can be used to constrain the important high mass end of the IMF. We consider the LMXB populations beyond the cores of the galaxies ($>0.2R_{e}$; covering $75-90\%$ of their stellar light) and find no evidence for systematic variations of the IMF with velocity dispersion ($\sigma$). We reject IMFs which become increasingly bottom heavy with $\sigma$, up to steep power-laws (exponent, $\alpha>2.8$) in massive galaxies ($\sigma>300$km/s), for galactocentric radii $>1/4\ R_{e}$. Previously proposed IMFs that become increasingly bottom heavy with $\sigma$ are consistent with these data if only the number of low mass stars $(<0.5M_{\odot}$) varies. We note that our results are consistent with some recent work which proposes that extreme IMFs are only present in the central regions of these galaxies. We also consider IMFs that become increasingly top-heavy with $\sigma$, resulting in significantly more LMXBs. Such a model is consistent with these observations, but additional data are required to significantly distinguish between this and an invariant IMF. For six of these galaxies, we directly compare with published IMF mismatch parameters from the Atlas3D survey, $\alpha_{dyn}$. We find good agreement with the LMXB population if galaxies with higher $\alpha_{dyn}$ have more top-heavy IMFs -- although we caution that our sample is quite small. Future LMXB observations can provide further insights into the origin of $\alpha_{dyn}$ variations.},

	Abstract = {We present the implementation of a Bayesian formalism within the Stochastically Lighting Up Galaxies (SLUG) stellar population synthesis code, which is designed to investigate variations in the initial mass function (IMF) of star clusters. By comparing observed cluster photometry to large libraries of clusters simulated with a continuously varying IMF, our formalism yields the posterior probability distribution function (PDF) of the cluster mass, age, and extinction, jointly with the parameters describing the IMF. We apply this formalism to a sample of star clusters from the nearby galaxy NGC 628, for which broad-band photometry in five filters is available as part of the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). After allowing the upper-end slope of the IMF ($\alpha_3$) to vary, we recover PDFs for the mass, age, and extinction that are broadly consistent with what is found when assuming an invariant Kroupa IMF. However, the posterior PDF for $\alpha_3$ is very broad due to a strong degeneracy with the cluster mass, and it is found to be sensitive to the choice of priors, particularly on the cluster mass. We find only a modest improvement in the constraining power of $\alpha_3$ when adding H$\alpha$ photometry from the companion H$\alpha$-LEGUS survey. Conversely, H$\alpha$ photometry significantly improves the age determination, reducing the frequency of multi-modal PDFs. With the aid of mock clusters we quantify the degeneracy between physical parameters, showing how constraints on the cluster mass that are independent of photometry can be used to pin down the IMF properties of star clusters.},

@article{Parker:2017qr,
	Abstract = {We analyse N-body and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of young star-forming regions to search for differences in the spatial distributions of massive stars compared to lower-mass stars. The competitive accretion theory of massive star formation posits that the most massive stars should sit in deeper potential wells than lower-mass stars. This may be observable in the relative surface density or spatial concentration of the most massive stars compared to other, lower-mass stars. Massive stars in cool--collapse N-body models do end up in significantly deeper potentials, and are mass segregated. However, in models of warm (expanding) star-forming regions, whilst the massive stars do come to be in deeper potentials than average stars, they are not mass segregated. In the purely hydrodynamical SPH simulations, the massive stars do come to reside in deeper potentials, which is due to their runaway growth. However, when photoionisation and stellar winds are implemented in the simulations, these feedback mechanisms regulate the mass of the stars and disrupt the inflow of gas into the clouds' potential wells. This generally makes the potential wells shallower than in the control runs, and prevents the massive stars from occupying deeper potentials. This in turn results in the most massive stars having a very similar spatial concentration and surface density distribution to lower-mass stars. Whilst massive stars do form via competitive accretion in our simulations, this rarely translates to a different spatial distribution and so any lack of primordial mass segregation in an observed star-forming region does not preclude competitive accretion as a viable formation mechanism for massive stars.},

	Abstract = {Matching the number counts and redshift distribution of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) without invoking modifications to the initial mass function (IMF) has proved challenging for semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation. We adopt a previously developed SAM that is constrained to match the $z = 0$ galaxy stellar mass function and implement three simple prescriptions to predict the submillimeter flux densities of the model galaxies; two depend solely on star formation rate, whereas the other also depends on the dust mass. By comparing the predictions of the models, we find that taking into account the dust mass, which affects the dust temperature and thus influences the far-infrared spectral energy distribution, is crucial for matching the number counts and redshift distribution of SMGs. Moreover, despite using a standard IMF, our model can match the observed SMG number counts and redshift distribution reasonably well, which contradicts the conclusions of some previous studies that a top-heavy IMF is needed to match these observations. Our results suggest that differences in the treatments of processes such as stellar feedback may enable some SAMs to reproduce the properties of the SMG population without IMF variation.},

	Abstract = {We present 2 mum (K band) spectra of 180 well-studied, optically visible, luminous stars. Most of the stars are of OB spectral type, but we have also included a number of Oe and Be stars, OBN and OBC stars, cool hypergiant stars, and high-mass X-ray binary stars. Our aim in studying normal OB stars is to develop an empirical relationship between 2 mum spectral features of these massive stars and their stellar temperature and luminosity. We find the system of lines between 2.0 and 2.2 mum is particularly good for differentiating the early- and mid-O type stars. In the late-O and early-B stars, differentiation becomes more difficult, as the features show only moderate changes. We have developed a spectral classification system for the K band to be used to estimate effective temperatures of 0 and early-B stars. We demonstrate that K-band spectroscopy is superior in estimating the temperature of hot, luminous stars than the traditional methods of using infrared or even optical photometric colors alone. The only requirements are that adequate resolution (R > 1000) and signal-to-noise (S/N ˜70) be achieved. With our classification system, stars behind large amounts of visible extinction, such as in young, heavily reddened H II regions throughout our Galaxy, may be identified and studied for the first time through 2 mum spectroscopy.  Emission lines are commonly seen in the K-band spectra of supergiant stars, however, the OBN super-giants, which have a higher ratio of some processed materials at their surface, may be more likely to show line emission, especially the He I singlet transition at 2.058 mum. This has led us to propose an evolutionary scenario for some of the Galactic center He I emission-line stars, which evokes rotational mixing (Maeder 1987; Langer 1992) to explain both the strong line emission and high luminosity of these mysterious sources.  We have compared our spectroscopic database with the most recent stellar atmosphere models. We are encouraged by the good match between the model line profiles at 2 mum of Schaerer et al. (1996b) and those observed in OB stars. Finally, we include a thorough discussion of the observational and reduction methods employed to obtain the spectra shown in this atlas for the benefit of those wishing to obtain similar, classification-quality, near-infrared spectra.},

	Abstract = {We present observations in eight wavebands from 1.25 to 24 mum of four dense cores: L204C-2, L1152, L1155C-2, and L1228. Our goals are to study the young stellar object (YSO) population of these cores and to measure the mid-infrared extinction law. With our combined near-infrared and Spitzer photometry, we classify each source in the cores as, among other things, background stars, galaxies, or embedded YSOs. L1152 contains three YSOs and L1228 has seven, but neither L204C-2 nor L1155C-2 appear to contain any YSOs. We estimate an upper limit of 7 × 10-5 to 5 × 10-4 L sun for any undiscovered YSOs in our cores. We also compute the line-of-sight extinction law toward each background star. These measurements are averaged spatially, to create chi2 maps of the changes in the mid-infrared extinction law throughout our cores, and also in different ranges of extinction. From the chi2 maps, we identify two small regions in L1152 and L1228 where the outflows in those cores appear to be destroying the larger dust grains, thus altering the extinction law in those regions. On average, however, our extinction law is relatively flat from 3.6 to 24 mum for all ranges of extinction and in all four cores. From 3.6 to 8 mum, this law is consistent with a dust model that includes larger dust grains than the diffuse interstellar medium, which suggests grain growth has occurred in our cores. At 24 mum, our extinction law is two to four times higher than predicted by dust models. However, it is similar to other empirical measurements.},

	Abstract = {Context. The properties of dust grains, in particular their size distribution, are expected to differ from the interstellar medium to the high-density regions within molecular clouds.  Aims: We measure the mid-infrared extinction law produced by dense material in molecular cloud cores. Since the extinction at these wavelengths is caused by dust, the extinction law in cores should depart from what is found in low-density environments if the dust grains have different properties.  Methods: We used the unbiased LINES method to measure the slope of the reddening vectors in color-color diagrams. We derived the mid-infrared extinction law toward the dense cores B59 and FeSt 1-457 in the Pipe Nebula over a range of visual extinction between 10 and 50 mag, using a combination of Spitzer/IRAC and ESO NTT/VLT data.  Results: The mid-infrared extinction law in both cores departs significantly from a power law between 3.6 and 8 mum, suggesting that these cores contain dust with a considerable fraction of large dust grains. We find no evidence of any dependence in the extinction law with column density up to 50 mag of visual extinction in these cores, and no evidence of any variation between our result and those for other clouds at lower column densities reported elsewhere in the literature. This suggests either that large grains are present even in low column density regions or that the existing dust models need to be revised at mid-infrared wavelengths. We find a small but significant difference in the extinction law of the two cores, which we tentatively associate with the onset of star formation in B59.  Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under program IDs 62.I-0866, 65.I-0083, 67.C-0514, and 069.C-0426.},

	Abstract = {A precise measure of the mid-infrared interstellar extinction law is crucial for investigating the properties of interstellar dust, especially larger-sized grains. Based on the stellar parameters derived from the SDSS-III/Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) spectroscopic survey, we select a large sample of G-type and K-type giants as the tracers of the Galactic mid-infrared extinction. We calculate the intrinsic stellar color excesses from the stellar effective temperatures and use them to determine the mid-infrared extinction for a given line of sight. For the entire sky of the Milky Way surveyed by APOGEE, we derive the extinctions (relative to {A}{{{K}}{{S}}}, the K S-band extinction at wavelength lambda = 2.16 mum) for the four Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) bands at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum, the four Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera bands at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 mum, the Spitzer/MIPS24 band at 23.7 mum, and, for the first time, the AKARI/S9W band at 8.23 mum. Our results agree with previous works in that the extinction curve is flat in the ˜3-8 mum wavelength range and is generally consistent with the {R}V = 5.5 model curve, except our determination exceeds the model prediction in the WISE/W4 band. Although some previous works found that the mid-IR extinction law appears to vary with the extinction depth {A}{{{K}}{{S}}}, no noticeable variation has been found in this work. The uncertainties are analyzed in terms of the bootstrap resampling method and Monte-Carlo simulation and are found to be rather small.},

	Abstract = {The sizes of interstellar grains are widely distributed, ranging from a few angstroms to a few micrometers. The ultraviolet (UV) and optical extinction constrains the dust in the size range of a couple hundredths of micrometers to several submicrometers. The near and mid infrared (IR) emission constrains the nanometer-sized grains and angstrom-sized very large molecules. However, the quantity and size distribution of micrometer-sized grains remain unknown because they are gray in the UV/optical extinction and they are too cold and emit too little in the IR to be detected by IRAS, Spitzer, or Herschel. In this work, we employ the ˜3-8 mum mid-IR extinction, which is flat in both diffuse and dense regions to constrain the quantity, size, and composition of the mum-sized grain component. We find that, together with nano- and submicron-sized silicate and graphite (as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), mum-sized graphite grains with C/H ≈ 137 ppm and a mean size of ˜1.2 mum closely fit the observed interstellar extinction of the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium from the far-UV to the mid-IR, as well as the near-IR to millimeter thermal emission obtained by COBE/DIRBE, COBE/FIRAS, and Planck up to lambda ≲ 1000 mum. The mum-sized graphite component accounts for ˜14.6% of the total dust mass and ˜2.5% of the total IR emission.  Dedicated to the late Professor J. Mayo Greenberg (1922.1.14-2001.11.29), of Leiden University who first suggested the possible existence of very large grains in the interstellar space.},

	Abstract = {Near-infrared color-excess and extinction ratios are essential for establishing the cosmic distance scale and probing the Galaxy, particularly when analyzing targets attenuated by significant dust. A robust determination of those ratios followed from leveraging new infrared observations from the VVV survey, wherein numerous bulge RR Lyrae and Type II Cepheids were discovered, in addition to BVJHKs(3.4 --> 22) mum data for classical Cepheids and O stars occupying the broader Galaxy. The apparent optical color-excess ratios vary significantly with Galactic longitude (l), whereas the near-infrared results are comparatively constant with l and Galactocentric distance (< E(J-overline{3.5 mu m)/E(J-K_s) > =1.28 $\pm$ 0.03}). The results derived imply that classical Cepheids and O stars display separate optical trends (RV,BV) with l, which appear to disfavor theories advocating a strict and marked decrease in dust size with increasing Galactocentric distance. The classical Cepheid, Type II Cepheid, and RR Lyrae variables are characterized by <AJ/E(J-Ks)> = <RJ,JKs> = 1.49 $\pm$ 0.05 (<AKs/AJ> = 0.33 $\pm$ 0.02), whereas the O stars are expectedly impacted by emission beyond 3.6 mum. The mean optical ratios characterizing classical Cepheids and O stars are approximately <RV,BV>   3.1 and <RV,BV>   3.3, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Based on the data obtained from the Spitzer/Galactic Legacy Infrared Midplane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIPMSE) Legacy Program and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) project, we derive the extinction in the four IRAC bands, [3.6], [4.5], [5.8], and [8.0] mum, relative to the 2MASS Ks band (at 2.16 mum) for 131 GLIPMSE fields along the Galactic plane within |l| <= 65o, using red giants and red clump giants as tracers. As a whole, the mean extinction in the IRAC bands (normalized to the 2MASS Ks band), A_{[3.6]}/A_{{K_{s}}}≈ 0.63$\pm$ 0.01, A_{[4.5]}/A_{{K_{s}}}≈ 0.57$\pm$ 0.03, A_{[5.8]}/A_{{K_{s}}}≈ 0.49$\pm$ 0.03, A_{[8.0]}/A_{{K_{s}}}≈ 0.55$\pm$ 0.03, exhibits little variation with wavelength (i.e., the extinction is somewhat flat or gray). This is consistent with previous studies and agrees with that predicted from the standard interstellar grain model for RV = 5.5 by Weingartner & Draine. As far as individual sightline is concerned, however, the wavelength dependence of the mid-infrared interstellar extinction A_{lambda}/A_{{K_{s}}} varies from one sightline to another, suggesting that there may not exist a "universal" IR extinction law. We, for the first time, demonstrate the existence of systematic variations of extinction with Galactic longitude which appears to correlate with the locations of spiral arms as well as with the variation of the far-infrared luminosity of interstellar dust.},

	Abstract = {We present new, more precise measurements of the mass and distance of our Galaxy's central supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. These results stem from a new analysis that more than doubles the time baseline for astrometry of faint stars orbiting Sgr A*, combining 2 decades of speckle imaging and adaptive optics data. Specifically, we improve our analysis of the speckle images by using information about a star's orbit from the deep adaptive optics data (2005-2013) to inform the search for the star in the speckle years (1995-2005). When this new analysis technique is combined with the first complete re-reduction of Keck Galactic Center speckle images using speckle holography, we are able to track the short-period star S0-38 (K-band magnitude = 17, orbital period = 19 yr) through the speckle years. We use the kinematic measurements from speckle holography and adaptive optics to estimate the orbits of S0-38 and S0-2 and thereby improve our constraints of the mass (M bh) and distance (R  o ) of Sgr A*: M bh = (4.02 $\pm$ 0.16 $\pm$ 0.04) × 106 M &sun; and 7.86 $\pm$ 0.14 $\pm$ 0.04 kpc. The uncertainties in M bh and R  o  as determined by the combined orbital fit of S0-2 and S0-38 are improved by a factor of 2 and 2.5, respectively, compared to an orbital fit of S0-2 alone and a factor of ˜2.5 compared to previous results from stellar orbits. This analysis also limits the extended dark mass within 0.01 pc to less than 0.13 × 106 M &sun; at 99.7% confidence, a factor of 3 lower compared to prior work.},

	Abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

@article{Zoccali:2003dw,
	Abstract = {We present a new determination of the metallicity distribution, age, and luminosity function of the Galactic bulge stellar population. By combining near-IR data from the 2MASS survey, from the SOFI imager at ESO NTT and the NICMOS camera on board HST we were able to construct color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and luminosity functions (LF) with large statistics and small photometric errors from the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and Red Giant Branch (RGB) tip down to  ~ 0.15 Msun. This is the most extended and complete LF so far obtained for the galactic bulge. Similar near-IR data for a disk control field were used to decontaminate the bulge CMDs from foreground disk stars, and hence to set a stronger constraint on the bulge age, which we found to be as large as that of Galactic globular clusters, or ga 10 Gyr. No trace is found for any younger stellar population. Synthetic CMDs have been constructed to simulate the effect of photometric errors, blending, differential reddening, metallicity dispersion and depth effect in the comparison with the observational data. By combining the near-IR data with optical ones, from the Wide Field Imager at the ESO/MPG 2.2 m telescope, a disk-decontaminated (MK,V-K) CMD has been constructed and used to derive the bulge metallicity distribution, by comparison with empirical RGB templates. The bulge metallicity is found to peak at near solar value, with a sharp cutoff just above solar, and a tail towards lower metallicity that does not appreciably extend below [M/H]  ~ -1.5.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile, obtained from the ESO/ST-ECF Science Archive Facility, and on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, operated by AURA Inc. under contract to NASA.},

	Abstract = {We have calculated improved photonic passbands for the UBVRI, Hipparcos Hp, and Tycho BT and VT standard systems using the extensive spectrophotometric libraries of NGSL and MILES. Using the Hp passband, we adjusted the absolute flux levels of stars in the spectrophotometric libraries so that their synthetic Hp magnitudes matched the precise Hipparcos Catalogue value. Synthetic photometry based on the renormalized fluxes was compared with the standard UBVRI, BT and VT magnitudes, and revised synthetic zero points were determined. The Hipparcos and Tycho photometry system zero points were also compared with the V-magnitude zero points of the SAAO UBVRI system, the homogenized UBV system, and the Walraven VB system. The confusion in the literature concerning broadband magnitudes, fluxes, passbands, and the choice of appropriate mean wavelengths is detailed and discussed in the Appendix.},

These data are being photometrically and astrometrically calibrated and will serve as a reference for many other purposes. In this paper, we present our determination of the Pan-STARRS1 photometric system: g P1, r P1, i P1, z P1, y P1, and w P1. The Pan-STARRS1 photometric system is fundamentally based on the Hubble Space Telescope Calspec spectrophotometric observations, which in turn are fundamentally based on models of white dwarf atmospheres. We define the Pan-STARRS1 magnitude system and describe in detail our measurement of the system passbands, including both the instrumental sensitivity and atmospheric transmission functions. By-products, including transformations to other photometric systems, Galactic extinction, and stellar locus, are also provided. We close with a discussion of remaining systematic errors.},

Astronomers unfamiliar with optical simulation techniques need access to PSF models that properly match the conditions of their observations, so any HST modeling software needs to be both easy-to-use and have detailed information on the telescope and instruments. The Tiny Tim PSF simulation software package has been the standard HST modeling software since its release in early 1992. We discuss the evolution of Tiny Tim over the years as new instruments and optical properties have been incorporated. We also demonstrate how Tiny Tim PSF models have been used for HST data analysis.

	Abstract = {We have measured stellar photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys in near ultraviolet (F275W, F336W), optical (F475W, F814W), and near infrared (F110W, F160W) bands for 117 million resolved stars in M31. As part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury survey, we measured photometry with simultaneous point-spread function (PSF) fitting across all bands and at all source positions after precise astrometric image alignment (<5-10 mas accuracy). In the outer disk, the photometry reaches a completeness-limited depth of F475W ~ 28, while in the crowded, high surface brightness bulge, the photometry reaches F475W ~ 25. We find that simultaneous photometry and optimized measurement parameters significantly increase the detection limit of the lowest-resolution filters (WFC3/IR) providing color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) that are up to 2.5 mag deeper when compared with CMDs from WFC3/IR photometry alone. We present extensive analysis of the data quality including comparisons of luminosity functions and repeat measurements, and we use artificial star tests to quantify photometric completeness, uncertainties and biases. We find that the largest sources of systematic error in the photometry are due to spatial variations in the PSF models and charge transfer efficiency corrections. This stellar catalog is the largest ever produced for equidistant sources, and is publicly available for download by the community.},

@article{Crowther:2006sh,
	Abstract = {We present optical studies of the physical and wind properties, plus CNO chemical abundances, of 25 O9.5-B3 Galactic supergiants. We employ non-LTE, line blanketed, extended model atmospheres, which provide a modest downward revision in the effective temperature scale of early B supergiants of up to 1-2 kK relative to previous non-blanketed results. The so-called "bistability jump" at B1 (Teff ˜ 21 kK) from Lamers et al. is rather a more gradual trend (with large scatter) from v∞/vesc˜3.4 for B0-0.5 supergiants above 24 kK to v∞/vesc˜ 2.5 for B0.7-1 supergiants with 20 kK <= Teff <= 24 kK, and v∞/vesc˜ 1.9 for B1.5-3 supergiants below 20 kK. This, in part, explains the break in observed UV spectral characteristics between B0.5 and B0.7 subtypes as discussed by Walborn et al. We compare derived (homogeneous) wind densities with recent results for Magellanic Cloud B supergiants and generally confirm theoretical expectations for stronger winds amongst Galactic supergiants. However, winds are substantially weaker than predictions from current radiatively driven wind theory, especially at mid-B subtypes, a problem which is exacerbated if winds are already clumped in the Halpha line forming region. In general, CNO elemental abundances reveal strongly processed material at the surface of Galactic B supergiants, with mean N/C and N/O abundances 10 and 5 times higher than the Solar value, respectively, with HD 2905 (BC0.7 Ia) indicating the lowest degree of processing in our sample, and HD 152236 (B1.5 Ia+) the highest.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the first optical variability study of the Westerlund 1 super star cluster in search of massive eclipsing binary systems. A total of 129 new variable stars have been identified, including the discovery of 4 eclipsing binaries that are cluster members, 1 additional candidate, 8 field binaries, 19 field delta Scuti stars, 3 field W UMa eclipsing binaries, 13 other periodic variables, and 81 long-period or nonperiodic variables. These include the known luminous blue variable, the B[e] star, 11 Wolf-Rayet stars, several supergiants, and other reddened stars that are likely members of Westerlund 1. The bright X-ray source corresponding to the Wolf-Rayet star WR 77o (B) is found to be a 3.51 day eclipsing binary. The discovery of a reddened detached eclipsing binary system implies the first identification of main-sequence stars in Westerlund 1.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of Australia Telescope Compact Array observations of the Westerlund 1 (Wd1) region in the SiO v = 1, J = 1-0, and H2O 616-523 maser lines, and we also report the analysis of maser properties of red supergiants (RSGs) associated with six massive clusters including Wd1. The primary purpose of this research is to explore possibilities of using maser emission for investigating the nature of massive clusters and associated RSGs. The SiO v = 1, J = 1-0, and H2O 616-523 maser lines are detected toward two of four known RSGs in Wd1. The large velocity ranges of maser emission are consistent with the RSG status. RSGs with maser emission tend to exhibit redder log (F 21/F 12) and [K-12.13] colors compared to RSGs with no maser emission. The mass-loss rates derived from dust radiative transfer modeling suggest that RSGs with maser emission tend to exhibit larger mass-loss rates compared to RSGs with no maser emission. In an extended sample of 57 RSGs in six massive clusters, detections in the SiO line tend to homogeneously distribute in absolute luminosity L, whereas those in the H2O line tend to distribute in a region with large L values.},

	Abstract = {We report on the study of interstellar extinction across the Tarantula Nebula (30 Doradus), in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using observations from the Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project in the 0.3-1.6 mum range. The considerable and patchy extinction inside the nebula causes about 3500 red clump stars to be scattered along the reddening vector in the colour-magnitude diagrams, thereby allowing an accurate determination of the reddening slope in all bands. The measured slope of the reddening vector is remarkably steeper in all bands than in the the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium. At optical wavelengths, the larger ratio of total-to-selective extinction, namely RV = 4.5 $\pm$ 0.2, implies the presence of a grey component in the extinction law, due to a larger fraction of large grains. The extra large grains are most likely ices from supernova ejecta and will significantly alter the extinction properties of the region until they sublimate in 50-100 Myr. We discuss the implications of this extinction law for the Tarantula Nebula and in general for regions of massive star formation in galaxies. Our results suggest that fluxes of strongly star-forming regions are likely to be underestimated by a factor of about 2 in the optical.},

	Abstract = {The dust extinction curve is a critical component of many observational programs and an important diagnostic of the physics of the interstellar medium. Here we present new measurements of the dust extinction curve and its variation toward tens of thousands of stars, a hundred-fold larger sample than in existing detailed studies. We use data from the APOGEE spectroscopic survey in combination with ten-band photometry from Pan-STARRS1, the Two Micron All-Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We find that the extinction curve in the optical through infrared is well characterized by a one-parameter family of curves described by R(V). The extinction curve is more uniform than suggested in past works, with sigma (R(V))=0.18, and with less than one percent of sight lines having R(V)\gt 4. Our data and analysis have revealed two new aspects of Galactic extinction: first, we find significant, wide-area variations in R(V) throughout the Galactic plane. These variations are on scales much larger than individual molecular clouds, indicating that R(V) variations must trace much more than just grain growth in dense molecular environments. Indeed, we find no correlation between R(V) and dust column density up to E(B-V)≈ 2. Second, we discover a strong relationship between R(V) and the far-infrared dust emissivity.},

	Abstract = {We investigate interstellar extinction curve variations towards ˜4 deg2 of the inner Milky Way in VIJKs photometry from the OGLE-III (third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) and VVV (VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea) surveys, with supporting evidence from diffuse interstellar bands and F435W, F625W photometry. We obtain independent measurements towards ˜2000 sightlines of AI, E(V - I), E(I - J) and E(J - Ks), with median precision and accuracy of 2 per cent. We find that the variations in the extinction ratios AI/E(V - I), E(I - J)/E(V - I) and E(J - Ks)/E(V - I) are large (exceeding 20 per cent), significant and positively correlated, as expected. However, both the mean values and the trends in these extinction ratios are drastically shifted from the predictions of Cardelli and Fitzpatrick, regardless of how RV is varied. Furthermore, we demonstrate that variations in the shape of the extinction curve have at least two degrees of freedom, and not one (e.g. RV), which we confirm with a principal component analysis. We derive a median value of <AV/AKs> = 13.44, which is ˜60 per cent higher than the `standard' value. We show that the Wesenheit magnitude WI = I - 1.61(I - J) is relatively impervious to extinction curve variations. Given that these extinction curves are linchpins of observational cosmology, and that it is generally assumed that RV variations correctly capture variations in the extinction curve, we argue that systematic errors in the distance ladder from studies of Type Ia supernovae and Cepheids may have been underestimated. Moreover, the reddening maps from the Planck experiment are shown to systematically overestimate dust extinction by ˜100 per cent and lack sensitivity to extinction curve variations.},

	Abstract = {The spatial structure of stellar populations with different chemical abundances in the Milky Way (MW) contains a wealth of information on Galactic evolution over cosmic time. We use data on 14,699 red-clump stars from the APOGEE survey, covering 4 {kpc}≲ R≲ 15 {kpc}, to determine the structure of mono-abundance populations (MAPs)---stars in narrow bins in [alpha /{Fe}] and [{Fe}/{{H}}]---accounting for the complex effects of the APOGEE selection function and the spatially variable dust obscuration. We determine that all MAPs with enhanced [alpha /{Fe}] are centrally concentrated and are well-described as exponentials with a scale length of 2.2+/- 0.2 {kpc} over the whole radial range of the disk. We discover that the surface-density profiles of low-[alpha /{Fe}] MAPs are complex: they do not monotonically decrease outwards, but rather display a peak radius ranging from ≈ 5 to ≈ 13 {kpc} at low [{Fe}/{{H}}]. The extensive radial coverage of the data allows us to measure radial trends in the thickness of each MAP. While high-[alpha /{Fe}] MAPs have constant scale heights, low-[alpha /{Fe}] MAPs flare. We confirm, now with high-precision abundances, previous results that each MAP contains only a single vertical scale height and that low-[{Fe}/{{H}}], low-[alpha /{Fe}] and high-[{Fe}/{{H}}], high-[alpha /{Fe}] MAPs have intermediate ({h}Z≈ 300{--}600 {pc}) scale heights that smoothly bridge the traditional thin- and thick-disk divide. That the high-[alpha /{Fe}], thick disk components do not flare is strong evidence against their thickness being caused by radial migration. The correspondence between the radial structure and chemical-enrichment age of stellar populations is clear confirmation of the inside-out growth of galactic disks. The details of these relations will constrain the variety of physical conditions under which stars form throughout the MW disk.},

	Abstract = {Context. The Galactic centre hosts a crowded, dense nuclear star cluster with a half-light radius of 4 pc. Most of the stars in the Galactic centre are cool late-type stars, but there are also ≳100 hot early-type stars in the central parsec of the Milky Way. These stars are only 3-8 Myr old.  Aims: Our knowledge of the number and distribution of early-type stars in the Galactic centre is incomplete. Only a few spectroscopic observations have been made beyond a projected distance of 0.5 pc of the Galactic centre. The distribution and kinematics of early-type stars are essential to understand the formation and growth of the nuclear star cluster.  Methods: We cover the central >4 pc2 (0.75 sq. arcmin) of the Galactic centre using the integral-field spectrograph KMOS (VLT). We extracted more than 1000 spectra from individual stars and identified early-type stars based on their spectra.  Results: Our data set contains 114 bright early-type stars: 6 have narrow emission lines, 23 are Wolf-Rayet stars, 9 stars have featureless spectra, and 76 are O/B type stars. Our wide-field spectroscopic data confirm that the distribution of young stars is compact, with 90% of the young stars identified within 0.5 pc of the nucleus. We identify 24 new O/B stars primarily at large radii. We estimate photometric masses of the O/B stars and show that the total mass in the young population is ≳12 000 M&sun;. The O/B stars all appear to be bound to the Milky Way nuclear star cluster, while less than 30% belong to the clockwise rotating disk. We add one new star to the sample of stars affiliated with this disk.  Conclusions: The central concentration of the early-type stars is a strong argument that they have formed in situ. An alternative scenario, in which the stars formed outside the Galactic centre in a cluster that migrated to the centre, is refuted. A large part of the young O/B stars is not on the disk, which either means that the early-type stars did not all form on the same disk or that the disk is dissolving rapidly.

	Abstract = {Context: In spite of a large number of recent publications about the massive stellar cluster Westerlund 1, its distance from the Sun remains uncertain with values as low as 1.1 kpc, but largely between 4 and 5 kpc.  Aims: The goal of this study is to determine a distance to Westerlund 1 independent of the characteristics of the stellar population and to study its neutral environment, using observations of atomic hydrogen.  Methods: The H I observations are taken from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey to study H I absorption in the direction of the H II region created by the members of Westerlund 1 and to investigate its environment as observed in the H I line emission. A Galactic rotation curve was derived using the recently revised values for the Galactic centre distance of R_&sun; = 7.6 kpc, and the velocity of the Sun around the Galactic centre of Theta_&sun; = 214 km s-1. This rotation curve successfully predicts the location of the Tangent point gas and the velocity of the Sagittarius Arm outside the solar circle on the far side of the Galaxy to within 4 km s-1. Compared to the typically used values of R_&sun; = 8.5 kpc and Theta_&sun; = 220 km s-1 this reduces kinematically determined distances by more than 10%.  Results: The newly determined rotation model leads us to derive a distance of 3.9 $\pm$ 0.7 kpc to Westerlund 1, consistent with a location in the Scutum-Crux Arm. Included in this estimate is a very careful investigation of possible sources of error for the Galactic rotation curve. We also report on small expanding H I features around the cluster with a maximum dynamic age of 600 000 years and a larger bubble which has a minimum dynamic age of 2.5 million years. Additionally we re-calculated the kinematic distances to nearby H II regions and supernova remnants based on our new Galaxic rotation curve.  Conclusions: We propose that in the early stages of the development of Wd 1 a large interstellar bubble of diameter about 50 pc was created by the cluster members. This bubble has a dynamic age similar to the age of the cluster. Small expanding bubbles, with dynamical ages ~0.6 Myr are found around Wd 1, which we suggest consist of recombined material lost by cluster members through their winds.},

	Abstract = {Context. Studies of the properties of the inner Galactic bulge strongly depend on the assumptions made about interstellar extinction. Most of the extinction maps available in the literature lack the information about the distance.  Aims: We combine observations with the Besan{\c c}on model of the Galaxy to investigate the variations of extinction along different lines of sight toward the inner Galactic bulge as a function of distance. In addition we study the variations in the extinction law in the bulge.  Methods: We constructed color-magnitude diagrams with the following sets of colors: H-Ks and J-Ks from the VVV catalog and Ks-[3.6], Ks-[4.5], Ks-[5.8] and Ks-[8.0] from GLIMPSE-II catalog matched with 2MASS. Using the newly derived temperature-color relation for M giants that match the observed color-magnitude diagrams better we then used the distance-color relations to derive the extinction as a function of distance. The observed colors were shifted to match the intrinsic colors in the Besan{\c c}on model as a function of distance, thereby iteratively creating an extinction map with three dimensions: two spatial and one distance dimension along each line of sight toward the bulge.  Results: Color excess maps are presented at a resolution of 15' × 15' for six different combinations of colors in distance bins of 1 kpc. The high resolution and depth of the photometry allows us to derive extinction maps to 10 kpc distance and up to 35 mag of extinction in AV (3.5 mag in AKs). Integrated maps show the same dust features and consistent values with the other 2D maps. Starting from the color excess between the observations and the model, we investigate the extinction law in near-infrared and its variation along different lines of sight.

	Abstract = {We combine near-infrared (Two Micron All Sky Survey) and mid-infrared (Spitzer-IRAC) photometry to characterize the IR extinction law (1.2-8 mum) over nearly 150$\,^{\circ}$ of contiguous Milky Way midplane longitude. The relative extinctions in five passbands across these wavelength and longitude ranges are derived by calculating color excess ratios for G and K giant red clump stars in contiguous midplane regions and deriving the wavelength dependence of extinction in each one. Strong, monotonic variations in the extinction law shape are found as a function of angle from the Galactic center, symmetric on either side of it. These longitudinal variations persist even when dense interstellar regions, known a priori to have a shallower extinction curve, are removed. The increasingly steep extinction curves toward the outer Galaxy indicate a steady decrease in the absolute-to-selective extinction ratio (RV ) and in the mean dust grain size at greater Galactocentric angles. We note an increasing strength of the 8 mum extinction inflection at high Galactocentric angles and, using theoretical dust models, show that this behavior is consistent with the trend in RV . Along several lines of sight where the solution is most feasible, A lambda/AKs  as a function of Galactic radius (R GC) is estimated and shown to have a Galactic radial dependence. Our analyses suggest that the observed relationship between extinction curve shape and Galactic longitude is due to an intrinsic dependence of the extinction law on Galactocentric radius.},

	Abstract = {Context. The nuclear star cluster of the Galaxy is an important template for understanding its extragalactic counterparts, which can currently not be resolved into individual stars. Important drawbacks of observations of the Galactic center are, however, the presence of strong and spatially highly variable interstellar extinction and extreme crowding of the sources, which makes the use of adaptive optics techniques necessary. Both points pose serious obstacles to precise photometry that is needed for analyzing the stellar population.  Aims: The aims of this work are to provide accurate photometry in multiple near-infrared broadband filters, to determine the power-law index of the extinction-law toward the central parsec of the Galaxy, to provide measurements of the absolute extinction toward the Galactic center, and finally to measure the spatial variability of extinction on arcsecond scales.  Methods: We use observations of the central parsec of the Milky Way that were obtained with the near-infrared camera and adaptive optics system NAOS/CONICA at the ESO VLT unit telescope 4. The photometric method takes into account anisoplanatic effects and limits the corresponding systematic uncertainties to ≲2%. Absolute values for the extinction in the H, Ks, and L'-bands as well as of the power-law indices of the H to Ks and Ks to L' extinction-laws are measured based on the well-known properties of red clump stars. Extinction maps are derived based on H-Ks and Ks-L' colors.  Results: We present Ks-band photometry for ~7700 stars, and additionally photometry for stars detected in the H and/or L'-bands. From a number of recently published values we compute a mean distance of the Galactic center of R0=8.03$\pm$0.15 kpc, which has an uncertainty of just 2%. Based on this R0 and on the RC method, we derive absolute mean extinction values toward the central parsec of the Galaxy of AH=4.48$\pm$0.13 mag, AKs=2.54$\pm$0.12 mag, and AL'=1.27$\pm$0.18 mag. We estimate values of the power-law indices of the extinction-law of alphaH-Ks=2.21$\pm$0.24 and alphaKs-L'=1.34$\pm$0.29. A Ks-band extinction map for the Galactic center is computed based on this extinction law and on stellar H-Ks colors. Both its statistical and systematic uncertainties are estimated to be <10%.

For wavelengths between 0.7 and 7 microns the observed extinction, both in the Galaxy and in the Magellanic clouds, appears to be consistent with a power law (Alambda proportional to lambda to the power of minus 1.75). In the 8 to 30 microns region interstellar extinction is dominated by the 9.7 microns and 18 microns silicate features; the absolute strength, the detailed wavelength-dependence of these features, and the possible variation of the profile shape from diffuse clouds to dense clouds, all remain controversial.

	Abstract = {The wavelength dependences of interstellar continuum extinction and polarization in the range 0.35-5 microns are examined. The existence of a universal extinction curve with power law index of about 1.8 extending from the near-IR to at least 5 microns appears to be established for both diffuse and dense cloud dust. The polarization yields evidence for some degree of universality in the 1.6-5 micron regime which may be represented by a power law with index 1.5-2.0, encompassing that for extinction. The form of the polarization curve in the IR seems independent of the wavelength at which the degree of polarization peaks in the optical, implying that variations in that wavelength are caused by changes in the optical properties of the particle at blue-visible rather than IR wavelengths. It is argued that the more significant alterations of the grain size distribution from one environment to another occur for the smaller particles.},

@article{Fitzpatrick:2009ys,
	Abstract = {We combine new observations from the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera of Survey with existing data to investigate the wavelength dependence of near-IR (NIR) extinction. Previous studies suggest a power law form for NIR extinction, with a "universal" value of the exponent, although some recent observations indicate that significant sight line-to-sight line variability may exist. We show that a power-law model for the NIR extinction provides an excellent fit to most extinction curves, but that the value of the power, beta, varies significantly from sight line to sight line. Therefore, it seems that a "universal NIR extinction law" is not possible. Instead, we find that as beta decreases, R(V) ≡ A(V)/E(B - V) tends to increase, suggesting that NIR extinction curves which have been considered "peculiar" may, in fact, be typical for different R(V) values. We show that the power-law parameters can depend on the wavelength interval used to derive them, with the beta increasing as longer wavelengths are included. This result implies that extrapolating power-law fits to determine R(V) is unreliable. To avoid this problem, we adopt a different functional form for NIR extinction. This new form mimics a power law whose exponent increases with wavelength, has only two free parameters, can fit all of our curves over a longer wavelength baseline and to higher precision, and produces R(V) values which are consistent with independent estimates and commonly used methods for estimating R(V). Furthermore, unlike the power-law model, it gives R(V)s that are independent of the wavelength interval used to derive them. It also suggests that the relation R(V) = -1.36 {E(K-V)}/{E(B-V)} - 0.79 can estimate R(V) to $\pm$0.12. Finally, we use model extinction curves to show that our extinction curves are in accord with theoretical expectations, and demonstrate how large samples of observational quantities can provide useful constraints on the grain properties.},

@article{Fitzpatrick:2007ys,
	Abstract = {We study the IR-through-UV interstellar extinction curves towards 328 Galactic B and late-O stars. We use a new technique which employs stellar atmosphere models in lieu of unreddened "standard" stars. This technique is capable of virtually eliminating spectral mismatch errors in the curves. It also allows a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigorous testing of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters, regardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the curves gives the following results: (1) In accord with our previous findings, the central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its width is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong correlations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region, and within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with extreme (i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic extinction curves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightline variation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve will always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an average curve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in significant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must include the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large sightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the various features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterize average extinction properties, they demonstrate that extinction curves respond sensitively to local conditions. Thus, each curve contains potentially unique information about the grains along its sightline.},

	Abstract = {Context. The commonly used extinction laws of Cardelli et al. (1989, ApJ, 345, 245) have limitations that, among other issues, hamper the determination of the effective temperatures of O and early B stars from optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry.  Aims: We aim to develop a new family of extinction laws for 30 Doradus, check their general applicability within that region and elsewhere, and apply them to test the feasibility of using optical and NIR photometry to determine the effective temperature of OB stars.  Methods: We use spectroscopy and NIR photometry from the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey and optical photometry from HST/WFC3 of 30 Doradus and we analyze them with the software code CHORIZOS using different assumptions, such as the family of extinction laws.  Results: We derive a new family of optical and NIR extinction laws for 30 Doradus and confirm its applicability to extinguished Galactic O-type systems. We conclude that by using the new extinction laws it is possible to measure the effective temperatures of OB stars with moderate uncertainties and only a small bias, at least up to E(4405-5495) ~ 1.5 mag.

	Abstract = {We have analyzed the 9.7 and ``18'' mum interstellar silicate absorption features along the line of sight toward four heavily extincted galactic WC-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. We construct two interstellar extinction curves from 1.25 to 25 mum using near-IR extinction measurements from the literature, along with the silicate profiles of WR 98a (representing the local ISM) and GCS 3 (representing the Galactic center). We have investigated the mineralogy of the interstellar silicates by comparing extinction profiles for amorphous silicates with olivine and pyroxene stoichiometry to the 9.7 and ``18'' mum absorption features in the WR 98a spectrum. In this analysis, we have considered solid and porous spheres and a continuous distribution of ellipsoids. While it is not possible to simultaneously provide a perfect match to both profiles, we find that the best match requires a mixture of these two types of compounds. We also consider iron oxides, aluminosilicates, and silicate carbide (SiC) as grain components. Iron oxides cannot be accommodated in the observed spectrum, while the amount of Si in SiC is limited to <4%. Finally, we discuss the cosmic elemental abundance constraints on the silicate mineralogy, grain shape, and porosity.  Based on observations with ISO, an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States (especially the PI countries: France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA.},

	Abstract = {Low-mass stars in their core-helium-burning stage define the sharpest feature present in the color-magnitude diagrams of nearby galaxy systems: the red clump (RC). This feature has given rise to a series of methods aimed at measuring the distributions of stellar distances and extinctions, especially in the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way Bulge. Because the RC is easily recognizable within the data of large spectroscopic and asteroseismic surveys, it is a useful probe of stellar densities, kinematics, and chemical abundances across the Milky Way disk; it can be applied up to larger distances than that allowed by dwarfs; and it has better accuracy than is possible with other kinds of giants. Here, we discuss the reasons for the RC narrowness in several sets of observational data, its fine structure, and the presence of systematic changes in the RC properties as regards age, metallicity, and the observed passband. These factors set the limits on the validity and accuracy of several RC methods defined in the literature.},

	Abstract = {In this Paper, we describe how we use stellar dynamics information to constrain the shape of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in a sample of 27 early-type galaxies from the CALIFA survey. We obtain dynamical and stellar mass-to-light ratios, Upsilondyn and Upsilon*, over a homogenous aperture of 0.5 Re. We use the constraint Upsilondyn>=Upsilon* to test two IMF shapes within the framework of the extended MILES stellar population models. We rule out a single power-law IMF shape for 75 per cent of the galaxies in our sample. Conversely, we find that a double power-law IMF shape with a varying high-mass end slope is compatible (within 1sigma) with 95 per cent of the galaxies. We also show that dynamical and stellar IMF mismatch factors give consistent results for the systematic variation of the IMF in these galaxies.},

@article{Sonnenfeld:2017ia,
	Abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) of early-type galaxies is the combination of the IMF of the stellar population formed in situ and that of accreted stellar populations. Using as an observable the effective IMF alphaIMF, defined as the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and the stellar mass inferred assuming a Salpeter IMF, we present a theoretical model for its evolution as a result of dry mergers. We use a simple dry-merger evolution model, based on cosmological N-body simulations, together with empirically motivated prescriptions for the IMF to make predictions on how the effective IMF of massive early-type galaxies changes from z = 2 to z = 0. We find that the IMF normalization of individual galaxies becomes lighter with time. At fixed velocity dispersion, alphaIMF is predicted to be constant with redshift. Current dynamical constraints on the evolution of the IMF are in slight tension with this prediction, even though systematic uncertainties, including the effect of radial gradients in the IMF, prevent a conclusive statement. The correlation of alphaIMF with stellar mass becomes shallower with time, while the correlation between alphaIMF and velocity dispersion is mostly preserved by dry mergers. We also find that dry mergers can mix the dependence of the IMF on stellar mass and velocity dispersion, making it challenging to infer, from z = 0 observations of global galactic properties, what is the quantity that is originally coupled with the IMF.},

The server can be accessed via the Cluster Collaboration webpage http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/timn/isochrones/. To achieve this, we have used the observed colours of member stars in young clusters with well-established age, distance and reddening to create fiducial loci in the colour-magnitude diagram. These empirical sequences have been used to quantify the discrepancy between the models and data arising from uncertainties in both the interior and atmospheric models, resulting in tables of semi-empirical bolometric corrections (BCs) in the various photometric systems. The model isochrones made available through the server are based on existing stellar interior models coupled with our newly derived semi-empirical BCs. As part of this analysis, we also present new cluster parameters for both the Pleiades and Praesepe, yielding ages of 135^{+20}_{-11} and 665^{+14}_{-7} {Myr} as well as distances of 132 $\pm$ 2 and 184 $\pm$ 2 pc, respectively (statistical uncertainty only).},

	Abstract = {We present a critical assessment of commonly used pre-main-sequence isochrones by comparing their predictions to a set of well-calibrated colour-magnitude diagrams of the Pleiades in the wavelength range 0.4-2.5 mum. Our analysis shows that for temperatures less than 4000 K, the models systematically overestimate the flux by a factor of 2 at 0.5 mum, though this decreases with wavelength, becoming negligible at 2.2 mum. In optical colours this will result in the ages for stars younger than 10 Myr being underestimated by factors of between 2 and 3.  We show that using observations of standard stars to transform the data into a standard system can introduce significant errors in the positioning of pre-main sequences in colour-magnitude diagrams. Therefore, we have compared the models to the data in the natural photometric system in which the observations were taken. Thus we have constructed and tested a model of the system responses for the Wide-Field Camera on the Isaac Newton Telescope.  As a benchmark test for the development of pre-main-sequence models, we provide both our system responses and the Pleiades sequence.},

All values are consistent with each other giving an average extinction power law of alpha = 2.14+0.04-0.05. This is much steeper than most laws previously derived in the literature from colour excess ratios, which are typically between 1.6 and 1.8. We show that this discrepancy is due to an inappropriate choice of filter wavelength in conversion from colour excess ratios to alpha and that effective rather than isophotal wavelengths are more appropriate. In addition, curved reddening tracks, which depend on the spectral type and filter system, should be used instead of straight vectors.},

	Abstract = {We present a joint analysis of the four most prominent sodium-sensitive features (Na D, Na I lambda8190{\AA}, Na I lambda1.14 mum, and Na I lambda2.21 mum), in the optical and near-infrared spectral ranges, of two nearby, massive (sigma ˜ 300 km s-1), early-type galaxies (named XSG1 and XSG2). Our analysis relies on deep Very Large Telescope/X-Shooter long-slit spectra, along with newly developed stellar population models, allowing for [Na/Fe] variations, up to ˜1.2 dex, over a wide range of age, total metallicity, and initial mass function (IMF) slope. The new models show that the response of the Na-dependent spectral indices to [Na/Fe] is stronger when the IMF is bottom heavier. For the first time, we are able to match all four Na features in the central regions of massive early-type galaxies finding an overabundance of [Na/Fe] in the range 0.5-0.7 dex and a bottom-heavy IMF. Therefore, individual abundance variations cannot be fully responsible for the trends of gravity-sensitive indices, strengthening the case towards a non-universal IMF. Given current limitations of theoretical atmosphere models, our [Na/Fe] estimates should be taken as upper limits. For XSG1, where line strengths are measured out to ˜0.8 Re, the radial trend of [Na/Fe] is similar to [alpha/Fe] and [C/Fe], being constant out to ˜0.5 Re, and decreasing by ˜0.2-0.3 dex at ˜0.8 Re, without any clear correlation with local metallicity. Such a result seems to be in contrast to the predicted increase of Na nucleosynthetic yields from asymptotic giant branch stars and Type II supernovae. For XSG1, the Na-inferred IMF radial profile is consistent, within the errors, with that derived from TiO features and the Wing-Ford band presented in a recent paper.},

We present a new search for variable stars in the vicinity of the cluster, using the five-year data base of the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) ESO Public Survey in the near-infrared. A total of 7586 objects were identified in the zone around 2 arcmin from the cluster centre, using 55 KS-band epochs. 33 stars show KS-band variability, 24 of them being previously undiscovered. Most of the variable stars found are slow/semiregular variables, long-period variables of the Mira type, and OH/IR stars. In addition, a good number of our candidates show variations in a rather short time-scale. We also propose four young stellar object candidates, which could be cluster members.},

	Abstract = {We provide tables of theoretical isochrones in several photometric systems. To this aim, the following steps are followed: (1) first, we re-write the formalism for converting synthetic stellar spectra into tables of bolometric corrections. The resulting formulas can be applied to any photometric system, provided that the zero-points are specified by means of either ABmag, STmag, VEGAmag, or a standard star system that includes well-known spectrophotometric standards. Interstellar absorption can be considered in a self-consistent way. (2) We assemble an extended and updated library of stellar intrinsic spectra. It is mostly based on ``non-overshooting'' ATLAS9 models, suitably extended to both low and high effective temperatures. This offers an excellent coverage of the parameter space of T_eff, log g, and [M/H]. We briefly discuss the main uncertainties and points still deserving more improvement. (3) From the spectral library, we derive tables of bolometric corrections for Johnson-Cousins-Glass, HST/WFPC2, HST/NICMOS, Washington, and ESO Imaging Survey systems (this latter consisting on the WFI, EMMI, and SOFI filter sets). (4) These tables are used to convert several sets of Padova isochrones into the corresponding absolute magnitudes and colours, thus providing a useful database for several astrophysical applications. All data files are made available in electronic form.},

@article{Dong:2012it,
	Abstract = {The central region of the Milky Way Galaxy provides a unique laboratory for a systematic, spatially resolved population study of evolved massive stars of various types in a relatively high-metallicity environment. We have conducted a multiwavelength data analysis of 180 such stars or candidates, most of which were drawn from a recent large-scale Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Near-Infrared Camera and MultiObject Spectrometer (NICMOS) narrow-band Paschen alpha survey, plus additional 14 Wolf-Rayet stars identified in earlier ground-based spectroscopic observations of the same field. The multiwavelength data include broad-band infrared (IR) photometry measurements from HST/NIC2, Simultaneous three-colour InfraRed Imager for Unbiased Surveys (SIRIUS), Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS), Spitzer/IRAC and X-ray observations from Chandra. We correct for extinctions towards individual stars, improve the Paschen alpha line equivalent width measurements, quantify the substantial mid-IR dust emission associated with carbon sequence Wolf-Rayet (WC) stars and find X-ray counterparts. In the process, we identify 10 foreground sources, some of which may be nearby cataclysmic variables. The nitrogen sequence Wolf-Rayet (WN) stars in the Arches and Central clusters show correlations between the Paschen alpha equivalent width and the adjacent continuum emission. However, the WN stars in the latter cluster are systematically dimmer than those in the Arches cluster, presumably due to the different ages of the two clusters. In the equivalent width-magnitude plot, late-type nitrogen sequence Wolf-Rayet (WNL) stars, WC stars and OB supergiants roughly fall into three distinct regions. We estimate that the dust mass associated with individual WC stars in the quintuplet cluster can reach 10-5 M&sun;, or more than one order of magnitude larger than previous estimates. Thus, WC stars could be a significant source of dust in the galaxies of the early Universe. Nearly half of the evolved massive stars in the Galactic Centre are located outside the three known massive stellar clusters. The ionization of several compact H II regions can be accounted for by their enclosed individual evolved massive stars, which thus likely formed in isolation or in small groups.},

	Abstract = {Outside of the known star clusters in the Galactic Centre, a large number of evolved massive stars have been detected; but their origins remain uncertain. We present a spectroscopic study of eight such stars, based on new Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) and Near-IR Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) near-infrared observations. This work has led to the discovery of a new O If+ star. We compare the reddening-corrected J - K versus K diagram for our stars with the massive ones in the Arches cluster and use stellar evolutionary tracks to constrain their ages and masses. The radial velocities of both the stars and their nearby H II regions are also reported. All of the stars are blueshifted relative to the Arches cluster by > 50 km s-1. We find that our source P35 has a velocity consistent with that of the surrounding molecular gas. The velocity gradient of nearby ionized gas along the Gemini GNIRS long slit, relative to P35 and the adjacent -30 to 0 km s-1 molecular cloud, can best be explained by a pressure-driven flow model. Thus, P35 most likely formed in situ. Three more of our stars have radial velocities different from their adjacent molecular gas, indicating that they are interlopers. The four stars closest to the Arches cluster have similar spectra, ages and masses to known cluster members, suggesting that they were likely ejected from the cluster via three-body interactions. Therefore, we find that the relatively isolated stars are partly form in situ and partly be ejected from the known star clusters in the Galactic Center.},

@article{Webb:2017pw,
	Abstract = {We make use of N-body simulations to determine the relationship between two observable parameters that are used to quantify mass segregation and energy equipartition in star clusters. Mass segregation can be quantified by measuring how the slope of a cluster's stellar mass function alpha changes with clustercentric distance r, and then calculating delta _alpha = d alpha (r)/d ln(r/r_m), where rm is the cluster's half-mass radius. The degree of energy equipartition in a cluster is quantified by eta, which is a measure of how stellar velocity dispersion sigma depends on stellar mass m via sigma(m) ∝ m-eta. Through a suite of N-body star cluster simulations with a range of initial sizes, binary fractions, orbits, black hole retention fractions, and initial mass functions, we present the co-evolution of deltaalpha and eta. We find that measurements of the global eta are strongly affected by the radial dependence of sigma and mean stellar mass and the relationship between eta and deltaalpha depends mainly on the cluster's initial conditions and the tidal field. Within rm, where these effects are minimized, we find that eta and deltaalpha initially share a linear relationship. However, once the degree of mass segregation increases such that the radial dependence of sigma and mean stellar mass become a factor within rm, or the cluster undergoes core collapse, the relationship breaks down. We propose a method for determining eta within rm from an observational measurement of deltaalpha. In cases where eta and deltaalpha can be measured independently, this new method offers a way of measuring the cluster's dynamical state.},

	Abstract = {The enormous velocities of the so called hypervelocity stars (HVSs) derive, likely, from close interactions with massive black holes, binary stars encounters or supernova explosions. In this paper, we investigate the origin of hypervelocity stars as consequence of the close interaction between the Milky Way central massive black hole and a passing-by young stellar cluster. We found that both single and binary HVSs may be generated in a burst-like event, as the cluster passes near the orbital pericentre. High velocity stars will move close to the initial cluster orbital plane and in the direction of the cluster orbital motion at the pericentre. The binary fraction of these HVS jets depends on the primordial binary fraction in the young cluster. The level of initial mass segregation determines the value of the average mass of the ejected stars. Some binary stars will merge, continuing their travel across and out of the Galaxy as blue stragglers.},

	Abstract = {Context. The ``mass discrepancy'' in massive O stars represents a long-standing problem in stellar astrophysics with far-reaching implications for the chemical and dynamical feedback in galaxies.  Aims: Our goal is to investigate this mass discrepancy by comparing state-of-the-art model masses with model-independent masses determined from eclipsing binaries.  Methods: Using stellar evolution models and a recent calibration of stellar parameters for O-star spectral sub-classes, we present a convenient way to convert observed solar metallicity O star spectral types into model masses, which we subsequently compare to our dynamical mass compilation. We also derive similar conversions for Large and Small Magellanic Cloud metallicities.  Results: We obtain a good agreement between model and dynamical masses, suggesting the long-standing problem of a systematic mass discrepancy problem may have been solved. We also provide error ranges for the model masses, as well as minimal and maximal age estimates for when the model stars are in a given spectral type box.

@article{Martins:2005ac,
	Abstract = {We present new calibrations of stellar parameters of O stars at solar metallicity taking non-LTE, wind, and line-blanketing effects into account. Gravities and absolute visual magnitudes are derived from results of recent spectroscopic analyses. Two types of effective temperature scales are derived: one from a compilation based on recent spectroscopic studies of a sample of massive stars - the "observational scale" - and the other from direct interpolations on a grid of non-LTE spherically extended line-blanketed models computed with the code CMFGEN (Hillier & Miller 1998) - the "theoretical scale". These T_eff scales are then further used together with the grid of models to calibrate other parameters (bolometric correction, luminosity, radius, spectroscopic mass and ionising fluxes) as a function of spectral type and luminosity class. Compared to the earlier calibrations of Vacca et al. (1996) the main results are: <itemized-list><item>[-] The effective temperature scales of dwarfs, giants and supergiants are cooler by 2000 to 8000 K, the theoretical scale being slightly cooler than the observational one. The reduction is the largest for the earliest spectral types and for supergiants. </item><item>[-] Bolometric corrections as a function of T_eff are reduced by 0.1 mag due to line blanketing which redistributes part of the UV flux in the optical range. For a given spectral type the reduction of BC is larger for early types and for supergiants. Typically BCs derived using the theoretical T_eff scale are 0.40 to 0.60 mag lower than that of Vacca et al. (1996), whereas the differences using the observational T_eff scale are somewhat smaller. </item><item>[-] Luminosities are reduced by 0.20 to 0.35 dex for dwarfs, by ~0.25 for all giants and by 0.25 to 0.35 dex for supergiants. The reduction is essentially the same for both T_eff scales. It is independent of spectral type for giants and supergiants and is slightly larger for late type than for early type dwarfs. </item><item>[-] Lyman continuum fluxes are reduced. Our theoretical values for the hydrogen ionising photon fluxes for dwarfs are 0.20 to 0.80 dex lower than those of Vacca et al. (1996), the difference being larger at late spectral types. For giants the reduction is of 0.25 to 0.55 dex, while for supergiants it is of 0.30 to 0.55 dex. Using the observational T_eff scale leads to smaller reductions at late spectral types. </item></itemized-list> The present results should represent a significant improvement over previous calibrations, given the detailed treatment of non-LTE line-blanketing in the expanding atmospheres of massive stars.},

	Abstract = {The young stellar cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1: l = 339.6$\,^{\circ}$, b = -0.4$\,^{\circ}$) is one of the most massive in the local Universe, but accurate parameters are pending on better determination of its extinction and distance. Based on our photometry and data collected from other sources, we have derived a reddening law for the cluster line-of-sight representative of the Galactic plane (-5$\,^{\circ}$ < b <+5$\,^{\circ}$) in the window 0.4-4.8 mum: The power-law exponent alpha = 2.13 $\pm$ 0.08 is much steeper than those published a decade ago (1.6-1.8) and our index RV = 2.50 $\pm$ 0.04 also differs from them, but in very good agreement with recent works based on deep surveys in the inner Galaxy. As a consequence, the total extinction AKs = 0.74 $\pm$ 0.08 (AV = 11.40 $\pm$ 2.40) is substantially smaller than previous results (0.91-1.13), part of which (AKs = 0.63 or AV = 9.66) is from the interstellar medium. The extinction in front of the cluster spans a range of DeltaAV ˜8.7 with a gradient increasing from SW to NE across the cluster face, following the same general trend of warm dust distribution. The map of the J - Ks colour index also shows a trend of reddening in this direction. We measured the equivalent width of the diffuse interstellar band at 8620 {\AA} (the `GAIA DIB') for Wd 1 cluster members and derived the relation AKs = 0.612 EW - 0.191 EW2. This extends the Munari et al. relation, valid for EB-V < 1, to the non-linear regime (AV > 4).},

	Abstract = {Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope adaptive optics bonnette images through narrowband filters in the K band are presented for the Arches cluster. Continuum fluxes, line fluxes, and equivalent widths are derived from high angular resolution images, some nearly diffraction limited, for the well-known massive stars in the Arches cluster. Images were obtained in the lines He I 2.06 mum, H I Brgamma (2.17 mum), and He II 2.19 mum, as well as continuum positions at 2.03, 2.14, and 2.26 mum. In addition, fluxes are presented for H I Palpha (1.87 mum) and a nearby continuum position (1.90 mum) from Hubble Space Telescope archival data.2 The 2 mum and Palpha data reveal two new emission-line stars and three fainter candidate emission-line objects. Indications for a spectral change of one object between earlier observations in 1992-1993 and our data from 1999 are found. The ratio of He II 2.19 mum to Brgamma emission exhibits a narrow distribution among the stars, suggesting a narrow evolutionary spread centered predominantly on spectral types O4 If or Wolf-Rayet stars of the WN7 subtype. From the approximate spectral types of the identified emission-line stars and comparisons with evolutionary models we infer a cluster age between ~2 and 4.5 Myr.},

	Abstract = {Using the Oxford Short Wavelength Integral Field specTrograph (SWIFT), we trace radial variations of initial mass function (IMF) sensitive absorption features of three galaxies in the Coma cluster. We obtain resolved spectroscopy of the central 5kpc for the two central brightest-cluster galaxies (BCGs) NGC4889, NGC4874, and the BCG in the south-west group NGC4839, as well as unresolved data for NGC4873 as a low-$\sigma_*$ control. We present radial measurements of the IMF-sensitive features sodium NaI$_{\rm{SDSS}}$, calcium triplet CaT and iron-hydride FeH0.99, along with the magnesium MgI0.88 and titanium oxide TiO0.89 features. We employ two separate methods for both telluric correction and sky-subtraction around the faint FeH feature to verify our analysis. Within NGC4889 we find strong gradients of NaI$_{\rm{SDSS}}$ and CaT but a flat FeH profile, which from comparing to stellar population synthesis models, suggests an old, $\alpha$-enhanced population with a Chabrier, or even bottom-light IMF. The age and abundance is in line with previous studies but the normal IMF is in contrast to recent results suggesting an increased IMF slope with increased velocity dispersion. We measure flat NaI$_{\rm{SDSS}}$ and FeH profiles within NGC4874 and determine an old, possibly slightly $\alpha$-enhanced and Chabrier IMF population. We find an $\alpha$-enhanced, Chabrier IMF population in NGC4873. Within NGC4839 we measure both strong NaI$_{\rm{SDSS}}$ and strong FeH, although with a large systematic uncertainty, suggesting a possible heavier IMF. The IMFs we infer for these galaxies are supported by published dynamical modelling. We stress that IMF constraints should be corroborated by further spectral coverage and independent methods on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis.},

	Abstract = {Recent photometric analysis of the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of young massive clusters (YMCs) have found evidence for splitting in the main sequence and extended main sequence turn-offs, both of which have been suggested to be caused by stellar rotation. Comparison of the observed main sequence splitting with models has led various authors to suggest a rather extreme stellar rotation distribution, with a minority ($10-30$\%) of stars with low rotational velocities and the remainder ($70-90$\%) of stars rotating near the critical rotation (i.e., near break-up). We test this hypothesis by searching for Be stars within two YMCs in the LMC (NGC 1850 and NGC 1856), which are thought to be critically rotating stars with decretion disks that are (partially) ionised by their host stars. In both clusters we detect large populations of Be stars at the main sequence turn-off ($\sim30-60$\% of stars), which supports previous suggestions of large populations of rapidly rotating stars within massive clusters.},

	Abstract = {Spectroscopic analyses of gravity-sensitive line strengths give growing evidence towards an excess of low-mass stars in massive early-type galaxies (ETGs). Such a scenario requires a bottom-heavy initial mass function (IMF). However, strong constraints can be imposed if we take into account galactic chemical enrichment. We extend the analysis of Weidner et al. and consider the functional form of bottom-heavy IMFs used in recent works, where the high-mass end slope is kept fixed to the Salpeter value, and a free parameter is introduced to describe the slope at stellar masses below some pivot mass scale (M < MP = 0.5 M&sun;). We find that no such time-independent parametrization is capable to reproduce the full set of constraints in the stellar populations of massive ETGs - resting on the assumption that the analysis of gravity-sensitive line strengths leads to a mass fraction at birth in stars with mass M < 0.5 M&sun; above 60 per cent. Most notably, the large amount of metal-poor gas locked in low-mass stars during the early, strong phases of star formation results in average stellar metallicities [M/H] ≲ -0.6, well below the solar value. The conclusions are unchanged if either the low-mass end cutoff, or the pivot mass are left as free parameters, strengthening the case for a time-dependent IMF.},

@article{Herczeg:2015ph,
	Abstract = {Absolute ages of young stars are important for many issues in pre-main-sequence stellar and circumstellar evolution but long have been recognized as difficult to derive and calibrate. In this paper, we use literature spectral types and photometry to construct empirical isochrones in Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for low mass stars and brown dwarfs in the eta Cha, ε Cha, and TW Hya Associations and the beta Pic and Tuc-Hor Moving Groups. A successful theory of pre-main-sequence evolution should match the shapes of the stellar loci for these groups of young stars. However, when comparing the combined empirical isochrones to isochrones predicted from evolutionary models, discrepancies lead to a spectral type (mass) dependence in stellar age estimates. Improved prescriptions for convection and boundary conditions in the latest models of pre-main-sequence evolution lead to a significantly improved correspondence between empirical and model isochrones, with small offsets at low temperatures that may be explained by observational uncertainties or by model limitations. Independent of model predictions, linear fits to combined stellar loci of these regions provide a simple empirical method to order clusters by luminosity with a reduced dependence on spectral type. Age estimates calculated from various sets of modern models that reproduce Li depletion boundary ages of the beta Pic Moving Group also imply a ˜4 Myr age for the low mass members of the Upper Sco OB Association, which is younger than the 11 Myr age that has been recently estimated for intermediate and high mass members.},

	Abstract = {Star formation lies at the center of a web of processes that drive cosmic evolution: generation of radiant energy, synthesis of elements, formation of planets, and development of life. Decades of observations have yielded a variety of empirical rules about how it operates, but at present we have no comprehensive, quantitative theory. In this review I discuss the current state of the field of star formation, focusing on three central questions: What controls the rate at which gas in a galaxy converts to stars? What determines how those stars are clustered, and what fraction of the stellar population ends up in gravitationally-bound structures? What determines the stellar initial mass function, and does it vary with star-forming environment? I use these three questions as a lens to introduce the basics of star formation, beginning with a review of the observational phenomenology and the basic physical processes. I then review the status of current theories that attempt to solve each of the three problems, pointing out links between them and opportunities for theoretical and numerical work that crosses the scale between them. I conclude with a discussion of prospects for theoretical progress in the coming years.},

	Abstract = {Samples of early-type galaxies show a correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) as inferred from gravity-sensitive absorption lines in the galaxies' central regions. To search for spatial variations in the IMF, we have observed two early-type galaxies with Keck/LRIS and measured radial gradients in the strengths of absorption features from 4000-5500 {\AA} and 8000-10000 {\AA}. We present spatially resolved measurements of the dwarf-sensitive spectral indices {Na} {{I}} (8190 {\AA}) and Wing-Ford {{FeH}} (9915 {\AA}), as well as indices for species of H, C2, CN, Mg, Ca, {{TiO}}, and Fe. Our measurements show a metallicity gradient in both objects, and Mg/Fe consistent with a shallow gradient in alpha-enhancement, matching widely observed trends for massive early-type galaxies. The {Na} {{I}} index and the CN1 index at 4160 {\AA} exhibit significantly steeper gradients, with a break at r˜ 0.1 {r}{{eff}} (r˜ 300 pc). Inside this radius, {Na} {{I}} strength increases sharply toward the galaxy center, consistent with a rapid central rise in [Na/Fe]. In contrast, the ratio of the {{FeH}} to Fe index strength decreases toward the galaxy center. This behavior cannot be reproduced by a steepening IMF inside of 0.1 {r}{{eff}} if the IMF is a single power law. While gradients in the mass function above ˜ 0.4 {M}&sun;  may occur, exceptional care is required to disentangle these IMF variations from the extreme variations in individual element abundances near the galaxies' centers.},

We compare 14 simulations of star cluster formation in 50 solar mass molecular cloud cores where the initial turbulence contains either purely solenoidal or purely compressive modes, in each case resolving fragmentation to the opacity limit to determine the resultant IMF. We find statistically indistinguishable IMFs between the two sets of calculations, despite a factor of two difference in the star formation rate and in the standard deviation of $\log(\rho)$. This suggests that the density PDF, while determining the star formation rate, is not the primary driver of the IMF.},

@article{Smith:2015mb,
	Abstract = {We present results from a blind survey to identify strong gravitational lenses among the population of low-redshift early-type galaxies. The SINFONI Nearby Elliptical Lens Locator Survey (SNELLS) uses integral-field infrared spectroscopy to search for lensed emission line sources behind massive lens candidates at z < 0.055. From 27 galaxies observed, we have recovered one previously known lens (ESO 325-G004) at z = 0.034, and discovered two new systems, at z = 0.031 and 0.052. All three lens galaxies have high velocity dispersions (sigma > 300 km s- 1) and alpha-element abundances ([Mg/Fe] > 0.3). From the lensing configurations we derive total J-band mass-to-light ratios of 1.8 $\pm$ 0.1, 2.1 $\pm$ 0.1 and 1.9 $\pm$ 0.2 within the ˜2 kpc Einstein radius. Correcting for estimated dark matter contributions, and comparing to stellar population models with a Milky Way (Kroupa) initial mass function (IMF), we determine the `mass excess factor', alpha. Assuming the lens galaxies have `old' stellar populations (10 $\pm$ 1 Gyr), the average IMF mass factor is <alpha> = 1.10 $\pm$ 0.08 $\pm$ 0.10, where the first error is random and the second is systematic. If we instead fit the stellar populations from 6dF optical survey spectra, all three galaxies are consistent with being old, but the age errors are 3-4 Gyr, due to limited signal-to-noise ratio. The IMF constraints are therefore looser in this case, with <alpha> = 1.23^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$\pm$ {0.10}. Our results are thus consistent with a Kroupa IMF (alpha = 1.00) on average, and strongly reject very heavy IMFs with alpha ≳ 2. A Salpeter IMF (alpha = 1.55) is inconsistent at the 3.5sigma level if the galaxies are old, but cannot be excluded using age constraints derived from the currently available optical spectra.},

	Abstract = {We present new observations of the closest known strong-lensing galaxy, the sigma ≈ 330 km s- 1 giant elliptical ESO325-G004, made with the ESO Very Large Telescope. The low redshift of the lens (zl = 0.035) results in arcs being formed at a small fraction of the effective radius (REin = 2.85 arcsec ≈ Reff/4). At such small radii, stars dominate the lensing mass, so that lensing provides a direct probe of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, with only small corrections needed for dark matter. However, the redshift of the galaxy lensed by ESO325-G004 was unknown until now, so the lensing mass was not securely determined. Using X-SHOOTER, we have detected multiple spectral lines, from two bright parts of the arc system, and measured a source redshift of zs = 2.141. Combined with lens modelling constraints, this yields a total mass inside the Einstein radius of 1.50 $\pm$ 0.06 × 1011 M&sun;. We estimate the range of possible contribution of dark matter to the lensing mass, using halo profile statistics from cosmological N-body simulations. Subtracting this component yields a stellar mass-to-light ratio for the lens of M*/LF814W = 3.14^{+0.24}_{-0.42} (M/L)_{{odot }, F814W}. Using VIMOS, we have also obtained very high signal-to-noise spectroscopy for the lens galaxy. Fitting models to this spectrum confirms that ESO325-G004 has a very old stellar population. For a Milky-Way-like (Kroupa) initial mass function (IMF), the stellar population fit yields a predicted stellar mass-to-light ratio of UpsilonMW = 3.01 $\pm$ 0.25 (M/L)&sun;, F814W. Hence, the mass attributable to stars with a Kroupa IMF is consistent with the lensing estimate. By contrast, a Salpeter (or heavier) IMF is disfavoured at the 99.8 per cent confidence level. A `heavyweight' IMF, with a mass twice as large as the Kroupa case, is firmly excluded for this galaxy. Such an IMF has been proposed for more distant elliptical lenses, and also to explain strong dwarf-star-sensitive spectral features, in particular the Na I 8200 {\AA} doublet. A FORS2 far-red spectrum shows that this feature is as strong in ESO325-G004 as it is in other high-sigma ellipticals, suggesting tension between dwarf-star indicators and lensing-mass constraints for this galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We perform a spectroscopic study to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by using a large sample of 24 781 early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-based Spheroids Panchromatic Investigation in Different Environmental Regions survey. Clear evidence is found of a trend between IMF and central velocity dispersion (sigma0), evolving from a standard Kroupa/Chabrier IMF at sigma0 ˜ 100 km s-1 towards a more bottom-heavy IMF with increasing sigma0, becoming steeper than the Salpeter function at sigma0 ≳ 220 km s-1. We analyse a variety of spectral indices, combining gravity-sensitive features, with age- and metallicity-sensitive indices, and we also consider the effect of non-solar abundance variations. The indices, corrected to solar scale by means of semi-empirical correlations, are fitted simultaneously with the (nearly solar-scaled) extended MILES (MIUSCAT) stellar population models. Similar conclusions are reached when analysing the spectra with a hybrid approach, combining constraints from direct spectral fitting in the optical with those from IMF-sensitive indices. Our analysis suggests that sigma0, rather than [alpha/Fe], drives the variation of the IMF. Although our analysis cannot discriminate between a single power-law (unimodal) IMF and a low-mass (≲0.5 M&sun;) tapered (bimodal) IMF, robust constraints can be inferred for the fraction in low-mass stars at birth. This fraction (by mass) is found to increase from ˜20 per cent at sigma0 ˜ 100 km s-1, up to ˜80 per cent at sigma0 ˜ 300 km s-1. However, additional constraints can be provided with stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios: unimodal models predict M/L significantly larger than dynamical M/L, across the whole sigma0 range, whereas a bimodal IMF is compatible. Our results are robust against individual abundance variations. No significant variation is found in Na and Ca in addition to the expected change from the correlation between [alpha/Fe] and sigma0.},

@article{Peacock:2014kv,
	Abstract = {A number of recent studies have proposed that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of early type galaxies varies systematically as a function of galaxy mass, with higher mass galaxies having bottom-heavy IMFs. These bottom-heavy IMFs have more low-mass stars relative to the number of high mass stars, and therefore naturally result in proportionally fewer neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). In this paper, we specifically predict the variation in the number of BHs and NSs based on the power-law IMF variation required to reproduce the observed mass-to-light ratio trends with galaxy mass. We then test whether such variations are observed by studying the field low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) populations of nearby early-type galaxies. In these binaries, an NS or BH accretes matter from a low-mass donor star. Their number is therefore expected to scale with the number of BHs and NSs present in a galaxy. We find that the number of LMXBs per K-band light is similar among the galaxies in our sample. These data therefore demonstrate the uniformity of the slope of the IMF from massive stars down to those now dominating the K-band light and are consistent with an invariant IMF. Our results are inconsistent with an IMF which varies from a Kroupa/Chabrier like IMF for low-mass galaxies to a steep power-law IMF (with slope x = 2.8) for high mass galaxies. We discuss how these observations constrain the possible forms of the IMF variations and how future Chandra observations can enable sharper tests of the IMF.

	Abstract = {We determine an absolute calibration of the initial mass function (IMF) of early-type galaxies, by studying a sample of 56 gravitational lenses identified by the Sloan Lenses ACS Survey. Under the assumption of standard Navarro, Frenk, and White dark matter halos, a combination of lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis models is used to disentangle the stellar and dark matter contribution for each lens. We define an "IMF mismatch" parameter alpha≡M LD *,Ein/M SPS *,Ein as the ratio of stellar mass inferred by a joint lensing and dynamical model (M LD *,Ein) to the current stellar mass inferred from stellar populations synthesis models (M SPS *,Ein). We find that a Salpeter IMF provides stellar masses in agreement with those inferred by lensing and dynamical models (langlog alpharang = -0.00 $\pm$ 0.03 $\pm$ 0.02), while a Chabrier IMF underestimates them (langlog alpharang = 0.25 $\pm$ 0.03 $\pm$ 0.02). A tentative trend is found, in the sense that alpha appears to increase with galaxy velocity dispersion. Taken at face value, this result would imply a non-universal IMF, perhaps dependent on metallicity, age, or abundance ratios of the stellar populations. Alternatively, the observed trend may imply non-universal dark matter halos with inner density slope increasing with velocity dispersion. While the degeneracy between the two interpretations cannot be broken without additional information, the data imply that massive early-type galaxies cannot have both a universal IMF and universal dark matter halos.

	Abstract = {Using the Oxford Short Wavelength Integral Field specTrograph, we investigate radial variations of several initial mass function (IMF) dependent absorption features in M31 and M32. We obtain high signal-to-noise spectra at six pointings along the major axis of M31 out to ˜700 arcsec (2.7 kpc) and a single pointing of the central 10 pc for M32. In M31 the sodium Na I lambda8190 index shows a flat equivalent width profile at ˜0.4 {\AA} through the majority of the bulge, with a strong gradient up to 0.8 {\AA} in the central 10 arcsec (38 pc); the Wing-Ford FeH lambda9916 index is measured to be constant at 0.4 {\AA} for all radii; and calcium triplet CaT lambdalambda8498, 8542, 8662 shows a gradual increase through the bulge towards the centre. M32 displays flat profiles for all three indices, with FeH at ˜0.5 {\AA}, very high CaT at ˜0.8 {\AA} and low Na I at ˜0.1 {\AA}. We analyse these data using stellar population models. We find that M31 is well described on all scales by a Chabrier IMF, with a gradient in sodium enhancement of [Na/Fe] ˜ +0.3 dex in the outer bulge, rising within the central 10 arcsec to perhaps [Na/Fe] ˜ +1.0 dex in the nuclear region. We find M32 is described by a Chabrier IMF and young stellar age in line with other studies. Models show that CaT is much more sensitive to metallicity and [alpha/Fe] than to IMF. We note that the centres of M31 and M32 have very high stellar densities and yet we measure Chabrier IMFs in these regions.},

	Abstract = {Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation appear to show a "two-phase" character with a rapid early phase at z >~ 2 during which "in situ" stars are formed within the galaxy from infalling cold gas followed by an extended phase since z <~ 3 during which "ex situ" stars are primarily accreted. In the latter phase, massive systems grow considerably in mass and radius by accretion of smaller satellite stellar systems formed at quite early times (z>3) outside of the virial radius of the forming central galaxy. These tentative conclusions are obtained from high-resolution re-simulations of 39 individual galaxies in a full cosmological context with present-day virial halo masses ranging from 7 × 1011 M sun h -1 lsimM vir <~ 2.7 × 1013 M sun h -1 (h = 0.72) and central galaxy masses between 4.5 × 1010 M sun h -1 <~ M * <~ 3.6 × 1011 M sun h -1. The simulations include the effects of a uniform UV background, radiative cooling, star formation, and energetic feedback from Type II supernova. The importance of stellar accretion increases with galaxy mass and toward lower redshift. In our simulations, lower mass galaxies (M * <~ 9 × 1010 M sun h -1) accrete about 60% of their present-day stellar mass. High-mass galaxy (M * >~ 1.7 × 1011 M sun h -1) assembly is dominated by accretion and merging with about 80% of the stars added by the present day. In general the simulated galaxies approximately double their mass since z = 1. For massive systems this mass growth is not accompanied by significant star formation. The majority of the in situ created stars are formed at z>2, primarily out of cold gas flows. We recover the observational result of "archaeological downsizing," where the most massive galaxies harbor the oldest stars. We find that this is not in contradiction with hierarchical structure formation. Most stars in the massive galaxies are formed early on in smaller structures; the galaxies themselves are assembled late.},

@article{Martin-Navarro:2015kq,
	Abstract = {The hypothesis of a universal initial mass function (IMF) - motivated by observations in nearby stellar systems - has been recently challenged by the discovery of a systematic variation of the IMF with the central velocity dispersion, sigma, of early-type galaxies (ETGs), towards an excess of low-mass stars in high-sigma galaxies. This trend has been derived so far from integrated spectra, and remains unexplained at present. To test whether such trend depends on the local properties within a galaxy, we have obtained new, extremely deep, spectroscopic data, for three nearby ETGs, two galaxies with high sigma (˜300 km s- 1), and one lower mass system, with sigma ˜ 100 km s- 1. From the analysis of IMF-sensitive spectral features, we find that the IMF depends significantly on galactocentric distance in the massive ETGs, with the enhanced fraction of low-mass stars mostly confined to their central regions. In contrast, the low-sigma galaxy does not show any significant radial gradient in the IMF, well described by a shallower distribution, relative to the innermost regions of massive galaxies, at all radii. Such a result indicates that the IMF should be regarded as a local (rather than global) property, and suggests a significant difference between the formation process of the core and the outer regions of massive ETGs.},

@article{Guszejnov:2016gs,
	Abstract = {A popular theory of star formation is gravito-turbulent fragmentation, in which self-gravitating structures are created by turbulence-driven density fluctuations. Simple theories of isothermal fragmentation successfully reproduce the core mass function (CMF) which has a very similar shape to the initial mass function (IMF) of stars. However, numerical simulations of isothermal turbulent fragmentation thus far have not succeeded in identifying a fragment mass scale that is independent of the simulation resolution. Moreover, the fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are scale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show that, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a mass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent cloud evolves. In addition, the cores that form undergo further fragmentation and after sufficient time forget about their initial conditions, yielding a scale-free pure power-law distribution dN/dM ∝ M-2 for the stellar IMF. We show that this problem can be alleviated by introducing additional physics that provides a termination scale for the cascade. Our candidate for such physics is a simple model for stellar radiation feedback. Radiative heating, powered by accretion on to forming stars, arrests the fragmentation cascade and imposes a characteristic mass scale that is nearly independent of the time-evolution or initial conditions in the star-forming cloud, and that agrees well with the peak of the observed IMF. In contrast, models that introduce a stiff equation of state for denser clouds but that do not explicitly include the effects of feedback do not yield an invariant IMF.},

	Abstract = {We measure equivalent widths (EWs)---focusing on two unique features (NaI and TiO2) of low-mass stars (lsim 0.3 M &sun;)---for luminous red galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and X-Shooter Lens Survey (XLENS) in order to study the low-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). We compare these EWs to those derived from simple stellar population models computed with different IMFs, ages, [alpha/Fe], and elemental abundances. We find that models are able to simultaneously reproduce the observed NaD lambda5895 and Na I lambda8190 features for lower-mass (~sigma*) early-type galaxies (ETGs) but deviate increasingly for more massive ETGs, due to strongly mismatching NaD EWs. The TiO2 lambda6230 and the Na I lambda8190 features together appear to be a powerful IMF diagnostic, with age and metallicity effects orthogonal to the effect of IMF. We find that both features correlate strongly with galaxy velocity dispersion. The XLENS ETG (SDSS J0912+0029) and an SDSS ETG (SDSS J0041-0914) appear to require both an extreme dwarf-rich IMF and a high sodium enhancement ([Na/Fe] = +0.4). In addition, lensing constraints on the total mass of the XLENS system within its Einstein radius limit a bottom-heavy IMF with a power-law slope to x <= 3.0 at the 90% CL. We conclude that NaI and TiO features, in comparison with state-of-the-art simple stellar population models, suggest a mildly steepening IMF from Salpeter (dn/dm vprop m -x  with x = 2.35) to x ≈ 3.0 for ETGs in the range sigma = 200-335 km s-1.},

	Abstract = {Much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emitted by their stars, which depends on the present number of each type of star in the galaxy. The present number depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which describes the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed, and knowledge of it is critical to almost every aspect of galaxy evolution. More than 50 years after the first IMF determination, no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal among different types of galaxies. Previous studies indicated that the IMF and the dark matter fraction in galaxy centres cannot both be universal, but they could not convincingly discriminate between the two possibilities. Only recently were indications found that massive elliptical galaxies may not have the same IMF as the Milky Way. Here we report a study of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the large representative ATLAS3D sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass, using detailed dynamical models. We find a strong systematic variation in IMF in early-type galaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratios, producing differences of a factor of up to three in galactic stellar mass. This implies that a galaxy's IMF depends intimately on the galaxy's formation history.},

	Abstract = {We present results of long NuSTAR (200 ks) and XMM-Newton (100 ks) observations of the Arches stellar cluster, a source of bright thermal (kT~2 keV) X-rays with prominent Fe XXV K_alpha 6.7 keV line emission and a nearby molecular cloud, characterized by an extended non-thermal hard X-ray continuum and fluorescent Fe K_alpha 6.4 keV line of a neutral or low ionization state material around the cluster. Our analysis demonstrates that the non-thermal emission of the Arches cloud underwent a dramatic change, with its homogeneous morphology, traced by fluorescent Fe K_alpha line emission, vanishing after 2012, revealing three bright clumps. The declining trend of the cloud emission, if linearly fitted, is consistent with half-life decay time of ~8 years. Such strong variations have been observed in several other molecular clouds in the Galactic Centre, including the giant molecular cloud Sgr B2, and point toward a similar propagation of illuminating fronts, presumably induced by the past flaring activity of Sgr A*.},

@article{Richer:2013dk,
	Abstract = {Based on the width of its main sequence, and an actual observed split when viewed through particular filters, it is widely accepted that 47 Tucanae contains multiple stellar populations. In this contribution, we divide the main sequence of 47 Tuc into four color groups, which presumably represent stars of various chemical compositions. The kinematic properties of each of these groups are explored via proper motions, and a strong signal emerges of differing proper-motion anisotropies with differing main-sequence color; the bluest main-sequence stars exhibit the largest proper-motion anisotropy which becomes undetectable for the reddest stars. In addition, the bluest stars are also the most centrally concentrated. A similar analysis for Small Magellanic Cloud stars, which are located in the background of 47 Tuc on our frames, yields none of the anisotropy exhibited by the 47 Tuc stars. We discuss implications of these results for possible formation scenarios of the various populations.},

	Abstract = {The study of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is a young and promising field of research. If IMBHs exist, they could explain the rapid growth of supermassive black holes by acting as seeds in the early stage of galaxy formation. Formed by runaway collisions of massive stars in young and dense stellar clusters, intermediate-mass black holes could still be present in the centers of globular clusters, today. Our group investigated the presence of intermediate-mass black holes for a sample of 10 Galactic globular clusters. We measured the inner kinematic profiles with integral-field spectroscopy and determined masses or upper limits of central black holes in each cluster. In combination with literature data we further studied the positions of our results on known black-hole scaling relations (such as M * - sigma) and found a similar but flatter correlation for IMBHs. Applying cluster evolution codes, the change in the slope could be explained with the stellar mass loss occurring in clusters in a tidal field over its life time. Furthermore, we present results from several numerical simulations on the topic of IMBHs and integral field units (IFUs). We ran N-body simulations of globular clusters containing IMBHs in a tidal field and studied their effects on mass-loss rates and remnant fractions and showed that an IMBH in the center prevents core collapse and ejects massive objects more rapidly. These simulations were further used to simulate IFU data cubes. For the specific case of NGC 6388 we simulated two different IFU techniques and found that velocity dispersion measurements from individual velocities are strongly biased towards lower values due to blends of neighboring stars and background light. In addition, we use the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE) to combine gravitational physics, stellar evolution and hydrodynamics to simulate the accretion of stellar winds onto a black hole.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we describe a new UV-initiative Hubble Space Telescope project (GO-13297) that will complement the existing F606W and F814W database of the Advanced Camera for Surveys Globular Cluster (GC) Treasury by imaging most of its clusters through UV/blue WFC3/UVIS filters F275W, F336W, and F438W. This ``magic trio'' of filters has shown an uncanny ability to disentangle and characterize multiple population (MP) patterns in GCs in a way that is exquisitely sensitive to C, N, and O abundance variations. Combination of these passbands with those in the optical also gives the best leverage for measuring helium enrichment. The dozen clusters that had previously been observed in these bands exhibit a bewildering variety of MP patterns, and the new survey will map the full variance of the phenomenon. The ubiquity of multiple stellar generations in GCs has made the formation of these cornerstone objects more intriguing than ever; GC formation and the origin of their MPs have now become one and the same problem. In this paper we will describe the database and our data reduction strategy, as well as the uses we intend to make of the final photometry, astrometry, and PMs. We will also present preliminary color-magnitude diagrams from the data so far collected. These diagrams also draw on data from GO-12605 and GO-12311, which served as a pilot project for the present GO-13297.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

@article{Elmegreen:2008eu,
	Abstract = {The characteristic mass Mc in the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is about constant for most star-forming regions. Numerical simulations consistently show a proportionality between Mc and the thermal Jeans mass MJ at the time of cloud fragmentation, but no models have explained how it can be the same in diverse conditions. Here we show that MJ depends weakly on density, temperature, metallicity, and radiation field in three environments: the dense cores where stars form, larger star-forming regions ranging from GMCs to galactic disks, and the interiors of H II regions and super star clusters. In dense cores, the quantity T3/2n-1/2 that appears in MJ scales with core density as n0.25 or with radiation density as U0.1 at the density where dust and gas come into thermal equilibrium. On larger scales, this quantity varies with ambient density as n-0.05 and ambient radiation field as U-0.033 when the Kennicutt-Schmidt law of star formation determines U(n) . In super star clusters with ionization and compression of prestellar globules, MJ varies as the 0.13 power of the cluster column density. These weak dependencies on n, U, and column density imply that most environmental variations affect the thermal Jeans mass by at most a factor of ~2. Cosmological increases in MJ, which have been suggested by observations, may be explained if the star formation efficiency is systematically higher at high redshift for a given density and pressure, if dust grains are smaller at lower metallicity, and so hotter for a given radiation field, or if small prestellar cores are more severely ionized in extreme starburst conditions.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies based on the integrated light of distant galaxies suggest that the initial mass function (IMF) might not be universal. Variations of the IMF with galaxy type and/or formation time may have important consequences for our understanding of galaxy evolution. We have developed a new stellar population synthesis (SPS) code specifically designed to reconstruct the IMF. We implement a novel approach combining regularization with hierarchical Bayesian inference. Within this approach, we use a parametrized IMF prior to regulate a direct inference of the IMF. This direct inference gives more freedom to the IMF and allows the model to deviate from parametrized models when demanded by the data. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques to reconstruct the best parameters for the IMF prior, the age and the metallicity of a single stellar population. We present our code and apply our model to a number of mock single stellar populations with different ages, metallicities and IMFs. When systematic uncertainties are not significant, we are able to reconstruct the input parameters that were used to create the mock populations. Our results show that if systematic uncertainties do play a role, this may introduce a bias on the results. Therefore, it is important to objectively compare different ingredients of SPS models. Through its Bayesian framework, our model is well suited for this.},

We have specifically studied how the time evolution of alpha(r) is affected by initial size, mass, binary fraction, primordial mass segregation, black hole retention, an external tidal field, and the initial mass function itself. Previous studies have shown that the evolution of alphaG is closely related to the amount of mass loss suffered by a cluster. Hence for each simulation we have also followed the evolution of the slope of the cluster's global stellar mass function, alphaG, and have shown that clusters follow a well-defined track in the alphaG-dalpha(r)/d(ln(r/rm)) plane. The location of a cluster on the alphaG - dalpha(r)/d(ln(r/rm)) plane can therefore constrain its dynamical history and, in particular, constrain possible variations in the stellar initial mass function. The alphaG-dalpha(r)/d(ln(r/rm)) plane thus serves as a key tool for fully exploiting the information contained in wide field studies of cluster stellar mass functions.},

	Abstract = {We here present the first spatially-resolved study of the IMF in external galaxies derived using a dynamical tracer of the mass-to-light ratio. We use the kinematics of relaxed molecular gas discs in seven early-type galaxies (ETGs) selected from the ATLAS3D survey to dynamically determine mass-to-light ratio (M/L) gradients. These M/L gradients are not very strong in the inner parts of these objects, and galaxies that do show variations are those with the highest specific star formation rates. Stellar population parameters derived from star formation histories are then used in order to estimate the stellar initial mass function function (IMF) mismatch parameter, and shed light on its variation within ETGs. Some of our target objects require a light IMF, otherwise their stellar population masses would be greater than their dynamical masses. In contrast, other systems seem to require heavier IMFs to explain their gas kinematics. Our analysis again confirms that IMF variation seems to be occurring within massive ETGs. We find good agreement between our IMF normalisations derived using molecular gas kinematics and those derived using other techniques. Despite this, we do not see find any correlation between the IMF normalisation and galaxy dynamical properties or stellar population parameters, either locally or globally. In the future larger studies which use molecules as tracers of galaxy dynamics can be used to help us disentangle the root cause of IMF variation.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a long-term orbit monitoring program, using sparse aperture masking observations taken with NIRC2 on the Keck-II telescope, of seven G- to M-type members of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Sco-Cen OB association. We present astrometry and derived orbital elements of the binary systems we have monitored, and also determine the age, component masses, distance, and reddening for each system using the orbital solutions and multi-band photometry, including Hubble Space Telescope photometry, and a Bayesian fitting procedure. We find that the models can be forced into agreement with any individual system by assuming an age, but that age is not consistent across the mass range of our sample. The G-type binary systems in our sample have model ages of ˜11.5 Myr, which is consistent with the latest age estimates for Upper Scorpius, while the M-type binary systems have significantly younger model ages of ˜7 Myr. Based on our fits, this age discrepancy in the models corresponds to a luminosity underprediction of 0.8-0.15 dex, or equivalently an effective temperature overprediction of 100-300 K for M-type stars at a given pre-main-sequence age. We also find that the M-type binary system RXJ 1550.0-2312 has an age (˜16 Myr) and distance (˜85 pc) consistent with membership in the Upper Centaurus Lupus subgroup.},

	Abstract = {We present 237 new spectroscopically confirmed pre-main-sequence K- and M-type stars in the young Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Sco-Cen association, the nearest region of recent massive star formation. Using the Wide-Field Spectrograph at the Australian National University 2.3 m telescope at Siding Spring, we observed 397 kinematically and photometrically selected candidate members of Upper Scorpius, and identified new members by the presence of lithium absorption. The HR-diagram of the new members shows a spread of ages, ranging from ˜3 to 20 Myr, which broadly agrees with the current age estimates of ˜5-10 Myr. We find a significant range of Li 6708 equivalent widths among the members, and a minor dependence of HR-diagram position on the measured equivalent width of the Li 6708 {\AA} line, with members that appear younger having more lithium. This could indicate the presence of either populations of different age, or a spread of ages in Upper Scorpius. We also use Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer data to infer circumstellar disc presence in 25 of the members on the basis of infrared excesses, including two candidate transition discs. We find that 11.2 $\pm$ 3.4 per cent of the M0-M2 spectral type (0.4-0.8 M&sun;) Upper Sco stars display an excess that indicates the presence of a gaseous disc.},

	Abstract = {We obtained the near-infrared (NIR) high-resolution (R ≡ lambda/Deltalambda ~ 20,000) spectra of the seven brightest early-type stars in the Cygnus OB2 association for investigating the environmental dependence of diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). The WINERED spectrograph mounted on the Araki 1.3 m telescope in Japan was used to collect data. All 20 of the known DIBs within the wavelength coverage of WINERED (0.91 < lambda < 1.36 mum) were clearly detected along all lines of sight because of their high flux density in the NIR wavelength range and the large extinction. The equivalent widths (EWs) of DIBs were not correlated with the column densities of C2 molecules, which trace the patchy dense component, suggesting that the NIR DIB carriers are distributed mainly in the diffuse component. On the basis of the correlations among the NIR DIBs both for stars in Cyg OB2 and stars observed previously, lambdalambda10780, 10792, 11797, 12623, and 13175 are found to constitute a ``family,'' in which the DIBs are correlated well over the wide EW range. In contrast, the EW of lambda10504 is found to remain almost constant over the stars in Cyg OB2. The extinction estimated from the average EW of lambda10504 (AV ~ 3.6 mag) roughly corresponds to the lower limit of the extinction distribution of OB stars in Cyg OB2. This suggests that lambda10504 is absorbed only by the foreground clouds, implying that the carrier of lambda10504 is completely destroyed in Cyg OB2, probably by the strong UV radiation field. The different behaviors of the DIBs may be caused by different properties of the DIB carriers.},

We obtained high-resolution (R = 28, 300) spectra of 25 early-type stars with color excesses of 0.07 < E(B - V) < 3.4. In addition to the 4 DIBs previously detected in this wavelength range, we identified 15 new DIBs, 7 of which were reported as DIB "candidates" by Cox. We analyze the correlations among NIR DIBs, strong optical DIBs, and the reddening of the stars. Consequently, we found that all NIR DIBs show weaker correlations with the reddening rather than the optical DIBs, suggesting that the equivalent widths of NIR DIBs depend on some physical conditions of the interstellar clouds, such as UV flux. Three NIR DIBs, lambdalambda10780, 10792, and 11797, are found to be classifiable as a "family," in which the DIBs are well correlated with each other, suggesting that the carriers of these DIBs are connected with some chemical reactions and/or have similar physical properties such as ionization potential. We also found that the three strongest NIR DIBs, lambdalambda10780, 11797, and 13175 are well correlated with the optical DIB lambda5780.5, whose carrier is proposed to be a cation molecule with high ionization potential, indicating that the carriers of the NIR DIBs could be cation molecules.

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of how best to correct astronomical data for the wavelength-dependent effects of Galactic interstellar extinction. The main general features of extinction from the IR through the UV are reviewed, along with the nature of observed spatial variations. The enormous range of extinction properties found in the Galaxy, particularly in the UV spectral region, is illustrated. Fortunately, there are some tight constraints on the wavelength dependence of extinction and some general correlations between extinction curve shape and interstellar environment. These relationships provide some guidance for correcting data for the effects of extinction. Several strategies for dereddening are discussed along with estimates of the uncertainties inherent in each method. In the Appendix, a new derivation of the wavelength dependence of an average Galactic extinction curve from the IR through the UV is presented, along with a new estimate of how this extinction law varies with the parameter R=A(V)/E(B-V). These curves represent the true monochromatic wavelength dependence of extinction and, as such, are suitable for dereddening IR-UV spectrophotometric data of any resolution and can be used to derive extinction relations for any photometry system.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the pre-main-sequence (PMS) population of the young star cluster Westerlund~2 (Wd2), the central ionizing cluster of the HII region RCW 49, using data from a high resolution multi-band survey with the Hubble Space Telescope. The data were acquired with the Advanced Camera for Surveys in the F555W, F814W, and F658N filters and with the Wide Field Camera 3 in the F125W, F160W, and F128N filters. We find a mean age of the region of 1.04+-0.72 Myr. The combination of dereddened F555W and F814W photometry in combination with F658N photometry allows us to study and identify stars with H_alpha excess emission. With a careful selection of 240 bona-fide PMS H_alpha excess emitters we were able to determine their H_alpha luminosity, which has a mean value L(H_alpha)=1.67 x 10^{-31} erg s^{-1}. Using the PARSEC 1.2S isochrones to obtain the stellar parameters of the PMS stars we determined a mean mass accretion rate \dot M_acc=4.43 x 10^{-8} M_sun yr^{-1} per star. A careful analysis of the spatial dependence of the mass-accretion rate suggests that this rate is ~25% lower in center of the two density peaks of Wd2 in close proximity to the luminous OB stars, compared to the Wd2 average. This rate is higher with increasing distance from the OB stars, indicating that the PMS accretion disks are being rapidly destroyed by the far-ultra-violet radiation emitted by the OB population.},

	Abstract = {Photometry of the Galactic bulge collected during the OGLE II microlensing search indicates high and nonuniform interstellar extinction toward the observed fields. I use the mean I-band magnitude and V-I color of red clump stars as a tracer of interstellar extinction toward four small regions of the Galactic bulge with highly variable reddening. A similar test is performed for the most reddened region observed in the LMC. I find that the slope of the location of red clump stars in the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) in the Galactic bulge is significantly smaller than the slope of the reddening line following the standard extinction law (RV=3.1) for approximations of the extinction curve by both Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis and Fitzpatrick. The differences are much larger for the Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis approximation which, on the other hand, indicates the same slopes for the control field in the LMC, contrary to the Fitzpatrick approximation. I discuss possible systematic effects that could cause the observed discrepancy. Anomalous extinction toward the Galactic bulge seems to be the most natural explanation. My data indicate that, generally, the ratio of the total to selective absorption, RVI, is much smaller toward the Galactic bulge than the value corresponding to the standard extinction curve (RV=3.1). However, RVI varies from one line of sight to another. My results explain why the red clump and RR Lyr stars in the Baade's window dereddened with standard value of RVI are redder compared to those of the local population.  On the basis of observations obtained with the 1.3 m Warsaw telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.},

	Abstract = {We have determined the ratios of total to selective extinction in the near-infrared bands (J,H,Ks) toward the Galactic center from the observations of the region |l|<~2.0d and 0.5d<~|b|<~1.0d with the IRSF telescope and the SIRIUS camera. Using the positions of red clump stars in color-magnitude diagrams as a tracer of the extinction and reddening, we determine the average of the ratios of total to selective extinction to be AKs/EH-Ks=1.44+/-0.01, AKs/EJ-Ks=0.494+/-0.006, and AH/EJ-H=1.42+/-0.02, which are significantly smaller than those obtained in previous studies. From these ratios, we estimate that AJ:AH:AKs=1:0.573+/-0.009:0.331+/-0.004 and EJ-H/EH-Ks=1.72+/-0.04, and we find that the power law Alambda~lambda-1.99+/-0.02 is a good approximation over these wavelengths. Moreover, we find a small variation in AKs/EH-Ks across our survey. This suggests that the infrared extinction law changes from one line of sight to another, and the so-called universality does not necessarily hold in the infrared wavelengths.},

@article{Schodel:2010kx,
	Abstract = {Context. Anisoplanatic effects can cause significant systematic photometric uncertainty in the analysis of dense stellar fields observed with adaptive optics. Program packages have been developed for a spatially variable PSF, but they require that a sufficient number of bright, isolated stars in the image are present to adequately sample the PSF.  Aims: Imaging the Galactic center is particularly challenging. We present two ways of dealing with spatially variable PSFs when only one or very few suitable PSF reference stars are present in the field.  Methods: Local PSF fitting with the StarFinder algorithm is applied to the data. Satisfying results can be found in two ways: (a) creating local PSFs by merging locally extracted PSF cores with the PSF wings estimated from the brightest star in the field; (b) Wiener deconvolution of the image with the PSF estimated from the brightest star in the field and subsequent estimation of local PSFs on the deconvolved image. The methodology is tested on real, and on artificial images.  Results: The method involving Wiener deconvolution of the image prior to local PSF extraction and fitting gives excellent results. It limits systematic effects to ~2-5% in point source photometry and ~10% in diffuse emission on fields-of-view as large as 28 arcsec ×28 arcsec and observed through the H-band filter. Particular attention is given to how deconvolution changes the noise properties of the image. It is shown that mean positions and fluxes of the stars are conserved by the deconvolution. However, the estimated uncertainties of the PSF fitting algorithm are too small if the presence of covariances is ignored in the PSF fitting as has been done here. An appropriate scaling factor can, however, be determined from simulated images or by comparing measurements on independent data sets.  Conclusions: We present ways of obtaining reliable photometry and astrometry from images with a spatially variable, but poorly sampled PSF, where standard techniques may not work.},

	Abstract = {We present a 0.6-4.1 mum spectroscopic sequence of M, L, and T dwarfs. The spectra have R≡lambda/Deltalambda~2000 from 0.9 to 2.4 mum and R=2500-200 from 2.9 to 4.1 mum. These new data nearly double the number of L and T dwarfs that have reported L-band spectra. The near-infrared spectra are combined with previously published red-optical spectra to extend the wavelength coverage to ~0.6 mum. Prominent atomic and molecular absorption features are identified including neutral lines of Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, Ti, Na, and K and 19 new weak CH4 absorption features in the H-band spectra of mid- to late-type T dwarfs. In addition, we detect for the first time the 0-0 band of the A 4Pi-X 4Sigma- transition of VO at ~1.06 mum in the spectra of L dwarfs and the P- and R-branches of the nu3 band of CH4 in the spectrum of a T dwarf. The equivalent widths of the refractory atomic features all decrease with increasing spectral type and are absent by a spectral type of ~L0, except for the 1.189 mum Fe I line, which persists to at least ~L3. We compute the bolometric luminosities of the dwarfs in our sample with measured parallaxes and find good agreement with previously published results that use L'-band photometry to account for the flux emitted from 2.5 to 3.6 mum. Finally, 2MASS J2224381-0158521 (L4.5) has an anomalously red spectrum and the strongest Deltanu=+2 CO bands in our sample. This may be indicative of unusually thick condensate clouds and/or low surface gravity.

	Abstract = {We derive the extinction curve toward the Galactic center (GC) from 1 to 19 mum. We use hydrogen emission lines of the minispiral observed by ISO-SWS and SINFONI. The extinction-free flux reference is the 2 cm continuum emission observed by the Very Large Array. Toward the inner 14'' × 20'', we find an extinction of A 2.166 mum = 2.62 $\pm$ 0.11, with a power-law slope of alpha = -2.11 $\pm$ 0.06 shortward of 2.8 mum, consistent with the average near-infrared slope from the recent literature. At longer wavelengths, however, we find that the extinction is grayer than shortward of 2.8 mum. We find that it is not possible to fit the observed extinction curve with a dust model consisting of pure carbonaceous and silicate grains only, and the addition of composite particles, including ices, is needed to explain the observations. Combining a distance-dependent extinction with our distance-independent extinction, we derive the distance to the GC to be R 0 = 7.94 $\pm$ 0.65 kpc. Toward Sgr A* (r < 0farcs5), we obtain AH = 4.21 $\pm$ 0.10, AKs = 2.42 $\pm$ 0.10, and A  L' = 1.09 $\pm$ 0.13.},

	Abstract = {Whether the near-infrared (NIR) extinction law is universal has long been a debated topic. Based on the APOGEE H-band spectroscopic survey, a key project of SDSS-III, the intrinsic colors of a large number of giant stars are accurately determined from the stellar effective temperature. Taking advantage of this and using a sample of 5942 K-type giants, the NIR extinction law is carefully revisited. The color excess ratio E(J - H)/E(J - K S), representative of the NIR extinction law, shows no dependence on the color excess when E(J - K S) changes from ~0.3 to ~4.0, which implies a universal NIR extinction law from diffuse to dense regions. The constant value of E(J - H)/E(J - K S), 0.64, corresponds to a power law index of 1.95. The other two ratios, E(H - K S)/E(J - K S) and E(J - H)/E(H - K S), are 0.36 and 1.78, respectively. The results are consistent with the MRN dust size distribution.},

	Abstract = {Context. Large spectroscopic surveys have in recent years enabled computing three-dimensional interstellar extinction maps thanks to the accurate stellar atmospheric parameters and line-of-sight distances these surveys provide. Interstellar extinction maps are complementary to 3D maps extracted from photometry and allow a more thorough studying of the dust properties.  Aims: Our goal is to use the high-resolution spectroscopic survey Gaia-ESO to obtain with a good distance resolution the interstellar extinction and its dependency as a function of the environment and the Galactocentric position.  Methods: We used the stellar atmospheric parameters of more than 5000 stars, obtained from the Gaia-ESO survey second internal data release, and combined them with optical (SDSS) and near-infrared (VISTA) photometry as well as different sets of theoretical stellar isochrones to calculate line-of-sight extinction and distances. The extinction coefficients were then compared with the literature to discuss their dependency on the stellar parameters and position in the Galaxy.  Results: Within the errors of our method, our work does not show any dependence of the interstellar extinction coefficient on the stellar atmospheric parameters. We find no evidence of a variation of E(J - H) /E(J - K) with the angle from the Galactic centre or with Galactocentric distance. This suggests that we are dealing with a uniform extinction law in the SDSS ugriz bands and the near-IR JHKs bands. Therefore, extinction maps built from mean colour-excesses that assume a constant extinction coefficient can be used without introducing any systematic errors.  Based on observations collected with the FLAMES spectrograph at the VLT/UT2 telescope (Paranal Observatory, ESO, Chile), for the Gaia-ESO Large Public Survey, programme 188.B-300.Appendix A is available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {We combine VI photometry from OGLE-III with VISTA Variables in The Via Lactea survey and Two Micron All Sky Survey measurements of E(J - Ks ) to resolve the longstanding problem of the non-standard optical extinction toward the Galactic bulge. We show that the extinction is well fit by the relation AI = 0.7465 × E(V - I) + 1.3700 × E(J - Ks ), or, equivalently, AI = 1.217 × E(V - I)(1 + 1.126 × (E(J - Ks )/E(V - I) - 0.3433)). The optical and near-IR reddening law toward the inner Galaxy approximately follows an RV ≈ 2.5 extinction curve with a dispersion {\sigma }_{R_{V}} \approx 0.2, consistent with extragalactic investigations of the hosts of Type Ia SNe. Differential reddening is shown to be significant on scales as small as our mean field size of 6'. The intrinsic luminosity parameters of the Galactic bulge red clump (RC) are derived to be (M_{I,RC}, \sigma _{I,RC,0}, (V-I)_{RC,0}, \sigma _{(V-I)_{RC}}, (J-K_{s})_{RC,0}) = (-0.12, 0.09, 1.06, 0.121, 0.66). Our measurements of the RC brightness, brightness dispersion, and number counts allow us to estimate several Galactic bulge structural parameters. We estimate a distance to the Galactic center of 8.20 kpc. We measure an upper bound on the tilt alpha ≈ 40$\,^{\circ}$ between the bulge's major axis and the Sun-Galactic center line of sight, though our brightness peaks are consistent with predictions of an N-body model oriented at alpha ≈ 25$\,^{\circ}$. The number of RC stars suggests a total stellar mass for the Galactic bulge of ~2.3 × 1010 M &sun; if one assumes a canonical Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), or ~1.6 × 1010 M &sun; if one assumes a bottom-light Zoccali IMF.

	Abstract = {We describe the public ESO near-IR variability survey (VVV) scanning the Milky Way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid-plane where star formation activity is high. The survey will take 1929 h of observations with the 4-m VISTA telescope during 5 years (2010-2014), covering ˜10 9 point sources across an area of 520 deg 2, including 33 known globular clusters and ˜350 open clusters. The final product will be a deep near-IR atlas in five passbands (0.9-2.5 mum) and a catalogue of more than 10 6 variable point sources. Unlike single-epoch surveys that, in most cases, only produce 2-D maps, the VVV variable star survey will enable the construction of a 3-D map of the surveyed region using well-understood distance indicators such as RR Lyrae stars, and Cepheids. It will yield important information on the ages of the populations. The observations will be combined with data from MACHO, OGLE, EROS, VST, Spitzer, HST, Chandra, INTEGRAL, WISE, Fermi LAT, XMM-Newton, GAIA and ALMA for a complete understanding of the variable sources in the inner Milky Way. This public survey will provide data available to the whole community and therefore will enable further studies of the history of the Milky Way, its globular cluster evolution, and the population census of the Galactic Bulge and center, as well as the investigations of the star forming regions in the disk. The combined variable star catalogues will have important implications for theoretical investigations of pulsation properties of stars.},

From these ratios, we derive AJ/AV = 0.188 $\pm$ 0.005; combining this with the near-infrared extinction ratios obtained in Paper I for more reddened fields near the Galactic center, we obtain AV:AJ:AH:AKs = 1:0.188:0.108:0.062, which implies steeply declining extinction toward longer wavelengths. In particular, it is striking that the Ks-band extinction is ≈1/16 the visual extinction AV, much smaller than the 1/10 usually employed.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery that UScoCTIO 5, a known spectroscopic binary in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region (P = 34 days, {M}{tot}{sin}(i)=0.64 {M}&sun; ), is an eclipsing system with both primary and secondary eclipses apparent in K2 light curves obtained during Campaign 2. We have simultaneously fit the eclipse profiles from the K2 light curves and the existing RV data to demonstrate that UScoCTIO 5 consists of a pair of nearly identical M4.5 stars with {M}A=0.329+/- 0.002 {M}&sun; , {R}A=0.834+/- 0.006 {R}&sun; , {M}B=0.317+/- 0.002 {M}&sun; , and {R}B=0.810+/- 0.006 {R}&sun; . The radii are broadly consistent with pre-main-sequence ages predicted by stellar evolutionary models, but none agree to within the uncertainties. All models predict systematically incorrect masses at the 25%-50% level for the HR diagram position of these mid-M dwarfs, suggesting significant modifications to mass-dependent outcomes of star and planet formation. The form of the discrepancy for most model sets is not that they predict luminosities that are too low, but rather that they predict temperatures that are too high, suggesting that the models do not fully encompass the physics of energy transport (via convection and/or missing opacities) and/or a miscalibration of the SpT-{T}{eff} scale. The simplest modification to the models (changing {T}{eff} to match observations) would yield an older age for this system, in line with the recently proposed older age of Upper Scorpius (tau ˜ 11 Myr).},

	Abstract = {Many stellar models present difficulties in reproducing basic observational relations of very low mass stars (VLMS), including the mass-radius relation and the optical colour-magnitudes of cool dwarfs. Here, we improve PARSEC (PAdova-TRieste Stellar Evolution Code) models on these points. We implement the T- tau relations from PHOENIX BT-Settl model atmospheres as the outer boundary conditions in the PARSEC code, finding that this change alone reduces the discrepancy in the mass-radius relation from 8 to 5 per cent. We compare the models with multiband photometry of clusters Praesepe and M67, showing that the use of T- tau relations clearly improves the description of the optical colours and magnitudes. But anyway, using both Kurucz and PHOENIX model spectra, model colours are still systematically fainter and bluer than the observations. We then apply a shift to the above T- tau relations, increasing from 0 at Teff = 4730 K to ˜14 per cent at Teff = 3160 K, to reproduce the observed mass-radius relation of dwarf stars. Taking this experiment as a calibration of the T- tau relations, we can reproduce the optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of low-mass stars in the old metal-poor globular clusters NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc, and in the intermediate-age and young solar-metallicity open clusters M67 and Praesepe. Thus, we extend PARSEC models using this calibration, providing VLMS models more suitable for the lower main-sequence stars over a wide range of metallicities and wavelengths. Both sets of models are available on PARSEC webpage.},

	Abstract = {Element by element, we have combined the optical components in the three cameras of the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and incorporated detector quantum efficiency curves and site-specific atmospheric transmissions, to create three relative spectral response curves (RSRs). We provide the absolute 2MASS attributes associated with ``zero magnitude'' in the JHKs bands so that these RSRs may be used for synthetic photometry. The RSRs tie 2MASS to the ``Cohen-Walker-Witteborn'' framework of absolute photometry and stellar spectra for the purpose of using 2MASS data to support the development of absolute calibrators for the Infrared Array Camera and pairwise cross-calibrators between all three SIRTF instruments. We examine the robustness of these RSRs to changes in water vapor within a night. We compare the observed 2MASS magnitudes of 33 stars (converted from the precision optical calibrators of Landolt and Carter-Meadows into absolute infrared calibrators from 1.2 to 35 mum) with our predictions, thereby deriving 2MASS ``zero-point offsets'' from the ensemble. These offsets are the final ingredients essential to merge 2MASS JHKs data with our other absolutely calibrated bands and stellar spectra, and to support the creation of faint calibration stars for SIRTF.},

	Abstract = {The new multi-epoch near-infrared VISTA Variables in the V{\'\i}a L{\'a}ctea (VVV) survey is sampling 562 deg2 of the Galactic bulge and adjacent regions of the disk. Accurate astrometry established for the region surveyed allows the VVV data to be merged with overlapping surveys (e.g., GLIMPSE, WISE, 2MASS, etc.), thereby enabling the construction of longer baseline spectral energy distributions for astronomical targets. However, in order to maximize use of the VVV data, a set of transformation equations are required to place the VVV JHKs photometry onto the 2MASS system. The impetus for this work is to develop those transformations via a comparison of 2MASS targets in 152 VVV fields sampling the Galactic disk. The transformation coefficients derived exhibit a reliance on variables such as extinction. The transformed data were subsequently employed to establish a mean reddening law of EJ-H/EH-Ks = 2.13 $\pm$ 0.04, which is the most precise determination to date and merely emphasizes the pertinence of the VVV data for determining such important parameters.

	Abstract = {Context. The ESO public survey VISTA variables in the V{\'\i}a L{\'a}ctea (VVV) started in 2010. VVV targets 562 sq. deg in the Galactic bulge and an adjacent plane region and is expected to run for about five years.  Aims: We describe the progress of the survey observations in the first observing season, the observing strategy, and quality of the data obtained.  Methods: The observations are carried out on the 4-m VISTA telescope in the ZYJHKs filters. In addition to the multi-band imaging the variability monitoring campaign in the Ks filter has started. Data reduction is carried out using the pipeline at the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit. The photometric and astrometric calibration is performed via the numerous 2MASS sources observed in each pointing.  Results: The first data release contains the aperture photometry and astrometric catalogues for 348 individual pointings in the ZYJHKs filters taken in the 2010 observing season. The typical image quality is 0.9 arcsec {-1.0 arcsec}. The stringent photometric and image quality requirements of the survey are satisfied in 100% of the JHKs images in the disk area and 90% of the JHKs images in the bulge area. The completeness in the Z and Y images is 84% in the disk, and 40% in the bulge. The first season catalogues contain 1.28 × 108 stellar sources in the bulge and 1.68 × 108 in the disk area detected in at least one of the photometric bands. The combined, multi-band catalogues contain more than 1.63 × 108 stellar sources. About 10% of these are double detections because of overlapping adjacent pointings. These overlapping multiple detections are used to characterise the quality of the data. The images in the JHKs bands extend typically  4 mag deeper than 2MASS. The magnitude limit and photometric quality depend strongly on crowding in the inner Galactic regions. The astrometry for Ks = 15-18 mag has rms  35-175 mas.  Conclusions: The VVV Survey data products offer a unique dataset to map the stellar populations in the Galactic bulge and the adjacent plane and provide an exciting new tool for the study of the structure, content, and star-formation history of our Galaxy, as well as for investigations of the newly discovered star clusters, star-forming regions in the disk, high proper motion stars, asteroids, planetary nebulae, and other interesting objects.

	Abstract = {Mass segregation in star clusters is often thought to indicate the onset of energy equipartition, where the most massive stars impart kinetic energy to the lower-mass stars and brown dwarfs/free floating planets. The predicted net result of this is that the centrally concentrated massive stars should have significantly lower velocities than fast-moving low-mass objects on the periphery of the cluster. We search for energy equipartition in initially spatially and kinematically substructured N-body simulations of star clusters with N = 1500 stars, evolved for 100 Myr. In clusters that show significant mass segregation we find no differences in the proper motions or radial velocities as a function of mass. The kinetic energies of all stars decrease as the clusters relax, but the kinetic energies of the most massive stars do not decrease faster than those of lower-mass stars. These results suggest that dynamical mass segregation - which is observed in many star clusters - is not a signature of energy equipartition from two-body relaxation.},

	Abstract = {We investigate whether open clusters (OCs) tend to energy equipartition, by means of direct N-body simulations with a broken power-law mass function. We find that the simulated OCs become strongly mass segregated, but the local velocity dispersion does not depend on the stellar mass for most of the mass range: the curve of the velocity dispersion as a function of mass is nearly flat even after several half-mass relaxation times, regardless of the adopted stellar evolution recipes and Galactic tidal field model. This result holds both if we start from virialized King models and if we use clumpy sub-virial initial conditions. The velocity dispersion of the most massive stars and stellar remnants tends to be higher than the velocity dispersion of the lighter stars. This trend is particularly evident in simulations without stellar evolution. We interpret this result as a consequence of the strong mass segregation, which leads to Spitzer's instability. Stellar winds delay the onset of the instability. Our simulations strongly support the result that OCs do not attain equipartition, for a wide range of initial conditions.},

	Abstract = {The United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Infrared Deep Sky Survey is a set of five surveys of complementary combinations of area, depth and Galactic latitude, which began in 2005 May. The surveys use the UKIRT Wide Field Camera (WFCAM), which has a solid angle of 0.21deg2. Here, we introduce and characterize the ZY JHK photometric system of the camera, which covers the wavelength range 0.83-2.37mum. We synthesize response functions for the five passbands, and compute colours in the WFCAM, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) bands, for brown dwarfs, stars, galaxies and quasars of different types. We provide a recipe for others to compute colours from their own spectra. Calculations are presented in the Vega system, and the computed offsets to the AB system are provided, as well as colour equations between WFCAM filters and the SDSS and 2MASS passbands. We highlight the opportunities presented by the new Y filter at 0.97-1.07mum for surveys for hypothetical Y dwarfs (brown dwarfs cooler than T), and for quasars of very high redshift, z > 6.4.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe the photometric calibration of data taken with the near-infrared Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT). The broad-band ZYJHK data are directly calibrated from Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) point sources which are abundant in every WFCAM pointing. We perform an analysis of spatial systematics in the photometric calibration, both inter- and intradetector show that these are present at up to the ~5per cent level in WFCAM. Although the causes of these systematics are not yet fully understood, a method for their removal is developed and tested. Following the application of the correction procedure, the photometric calibration of WFCAM is found to be accurate to ~=1.5per cent for the JHK bands and 2per cent for the ZY bands, meeting the survey requirements. We investigate the transformations between the 2MASS and WFCAM systems and find that the Z and Y calibrations are sensitive to the effects of interstellar reddening for large values of E(B - V)', but that the JHK filters remain largely unaffected. We measure a small correction to the WFCAM Y-band photometry required to place WFCAM on a Vega system, and investigate WFCAM measurements of published standard stars from the list of UKIRT faint standards. Finally, we present empirically determined throughput measurements for WFCAM.},

	Abstract = {Observers, numerical experimenters, and theorists use a misleadingly similar language when describing star clusters, although the operational definitions of quantities such as core radius and central density differ considerably. These differences are investigated, and a class of coordinate-independent, scale-free measurements for local and global quantities, particularly suited to small N-body systems, are introduced. It is shown, by means of analytical estimates and Monte Carlo experiments, that the quantities measured are closely related to independently defined global parameters, such as the core radius and the core density. Similarities and differences between these and the definitions for corresponding quantities which are used for observations and for theoretical models, considering finite-number effects as well as those systematic discrepancies which persist in the continuum limit, are discussed. This discussion applies both to star clusters and to clusters of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We present a study of star formation in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy through the association of three star formation indicators: 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers, 22 GHz H2O masers, and enhanced 4.5 mum emission (`green') sources. We explore how star formation in the CMZ(|l| < 1.3$\,^{\circ}$, |b| < 10') compares with that of the Galactic disk (6 $\,^{\circ}$> l > 345$\,^{\circ}$, |b| < 2$\,^{\circ}$).  Methods: Using an automated algorithm, we search for green sources toward 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers detected in the Parkes Methanol Multibeam Survey. We combine these results with lists of 22 GHz H2O masers, including our Mopra survey of the CMZ.  Results: We find that the correlation of CH3OH masers with green sources is a function of Galactic latitude, with a minimum close to b = 0 and increasing with |b| (toward the central part of the Galaxy, 6 $\,^{\circ}$> l > 345$\,^{\circ}$, |b| < 2$\,^{\circ}$). We find no significant difference between the correlation rate of CH3OH masers with green sources in the CMZ and the disk. This suggests that although the physical conditions of the gas are different in the CMZ from that of the Galactic disk, once gravitational instability sets in at sufficiently high densities, signatures of star formation appear to be similar in both regions. Moreover, the detection of green sources, even at the distance of the Galactic center, shows that our technique can easily identify the early stages of star formation, especially in low-extinction regions of the Galaxy. Through the association of H2O and CH3OH masers, we identify 15 star-forming sites in the CMZ. We find a higher correlation rate of coincident H2O and CH3OH masers within the CMZ compared to the Galactic disk, indicating a difference in the maser evolutionary sequence for star-forming cores in these two regions.

	Abstract = {Aims: We aim at a detailed description of the kinematic properties of the old, (several Gyrs) late-type CO-absorption star population among the Galactic centre (GC) cluster stars. This cluster is composed of a central supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) and a self-gravitating system of stars. Understanding its kinematics thus offers the opportunity to understand the dynamical interaction between a central point mass and the surrounding stars in general, especially in view of understanding other galactic nuclei.  Methods: We applied AO-assisted, near-infrared imaging and integral-field spectroscopy using the instruments NAOS/CONICA and SINFONI at the VLT. We obtained proper motions for 5445 stars, 3D velocities for 664 stars, and acceleration limits (in the sky plane) for 750 stars. Global kinematic properties were analysed using velocity and velocity dispersion distributions, phase-space maps, two-point correlation functions, and the Jeans equation.  Results: We detect for the first time significant cluster rotation in the sense of the general Galactic rotation in proper motions. Out of the 3D velocity dispersion, we derive an improved statistical parallax for the GC of R0 = 8.07 $\pm$ 0.32_stat $\pm$ 0.13_sys kpc. The distribution of 3D stellar speeds can be approximated by local Maxwellian distributions. Kinematic modelling provides deprojected 3D kinematic parameters, including the mass profile of the cluster. We find an upper limit of 4% for the amplitude of fluctuations in the phase-space distribution of the cluster stars compared to a uniform, spherical model cluster. Using upper limits on accelerations, we constrain the minimum line-of-sight distances from the plane of Sgr A* of five stars located within the innermost few (projected) arcsec. The stars within 0.7'' radius from the star group IRS13E do not co-move with this group, making it unlikely that IRS13E is the core of a substantial star cluster. Overall, the GC late-type cluster is described well as a uniform, isotropic, rotating, dynamically relaxed, phase-mixed system.

	Abstract = {One of the key questions in the field of star formation is the role of stellar feedback on subsequent star formation process. The W3 giant molecular cloud complex at the western border of the W4 super bubble is thought to be influenced by the stellar winds of the massive stars in W4. AFGL333 is a ~10^4 Msun cloud within W3. This paper presents a study of the star formation activity within AFGL333 using deep JHKs photometry obtained from the NOAO Extremely Wide-Field Infrared Imager combined with Spitzer-IRAC-MIPS photometry. Based on the infrared excess, we identify 812 candidate young stellar objects in the complex, of which 99 are classified as Class I and 713 are classified as Class II sources. The stellar density analysis of young stellar objects reveals three major stellar aggregates within AFGL333, named here AFGL333-main, AFGL333-NW1 and AFGL333-NW2. The disk fraction within AFGL333 is estimated to be ~50-60%. We use the extinction map made from the H-Ks colors of the background stars to understand the cloud structure and to estimate the cloud mass. The CO-derived extinction map corroborates the cloud structure and mass estimates from NIR color method. From the stellar mass and cloud mass associated with AFGL333, we infer that the region is currently forming stars with an efficiency of ~4.5% and at a rate of ~2 - 3 Msun Myr-1pc-2. In general, the star formation activity within AFGL333 is comparable to that of nearby low mass star-forming regions. We do not find any strong evidence to suggest that the stellar feedback from the massive stars of nearby W4 super bubble has affected the global star formation properties of the AFGL333 region.},

	Abstract = {We derive new constraints on the mass, rotation, orbit structure, and statistical parallax of the Galactic old nuclear star cluster and the mass of the supermassive black hole. We combine star counts and kinematic data from Fritz et al., including 2500 line-of-sight velocities and 10 000 proper motions obtained with VLT instruments. We show that the difference between the proper motion dispersions sigmal and sigmab cannot be explained by rotation, but is a consequence of the flattening of the nuclear cluster. We fit the surface density distribution of stars in the central 1000 arcsec by a superposition of a spheroidal cluster with scale ˜100 arcsec and a much larger nuclear disc component. We compute the self-consistent two-integral distribution function f(E, Lz) for this density model, and add rotation self-consistently. We find that (i) the orbit structure of the f(E, Lz) gives an excellent match to the observed velocity dispersion profiles as well as the proper motion and line-of-sight velocity histograms, including the double-peak in the vl-histograms. (ii) This requires an axial ratio near q1 = 0.7 consistent with our determination from star counts, q1 = 0.73 $\pm$ 0.04 for r < 70 arcsec. (iii) The nuclear star cluster is approximately described by an isotropic rotator model. (iv) Using the corresponding Jeans equations to fit the proper motion and line-of-sight velocity dispersions, we obtain best estimates for the nuclear star cluster mass, black hole mass, and distance M*(r < 100 arcsec) = (8.94 $\pm$ 0.31|stat $\pm$ 0.9|syst) × 106 M&sun;, M* = (3.86 $\pm$ 0.14|stat $\pm$ 0.4|syst) × 106 M&sun;, and R0 = 8.27 $\pm$ 0.09|stat $\pm$ 0.1|syst kpc, where the estimated systematic errors account for additional uncertainties in the dynamical modelling. (v) The combination of the cluster dynamics with the S-star orbits around Sgr A* strongly reduces the degeneracy between black hole mass and Galactic Centre distance present in previous S-star studies. A joint statistical analysis with the results of Gillessen et al., gives M* = (4.23 $\pm$ 0.14) × 106 M&sun; and R0 = 8.33 $\pm$ 0.11 kpc.},

	Abstract = {The inner Milky Way is dominated by a boxy, triaxial bulge which is believed to have formed through disc instability processes. Despite its proximity, its large-scale properties are still not very well known, due to our position in the obscuring Galactic disc. Here, we make a measurement of the three-dimensional density distribution of the Galactic bulge using red clump giants identified in DR1 of the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea survey. Our density map covers the inner (2.2 × 1.4 × 1.1) kpc of the bulge/bar. Line-of-sight density distributions are estimated by deconvolving extinction- and completeness-corrected Ks-band magnitude distributions. In constructing our measurement, we assume that the three-dimensional bulge is eightfold mirror triaxially symmetric. In doing so, we measure the angle of the bar-bulge to the line of sight to be (27 $\pm$ 2)$\,^{\circ}$, where the dominant error is systematic arising from the details of the deconvolution process. The resulting density distribution shows a highly elongated bar with projected axis ratios ≈(1 : 2.1) for isophotes reaching ˜2 kpc along the major axis. Along the bar axes the density falls off roughly exponentially, with axis ratios (10 : 6.3 : 2.6) and exponential scalelengths (0.70 : 0.44 : 0.18) kpc. From about 400 pc above the Galactic plane, the bulge density distribution displays a prominent X-structure. Overall, the density distribution of the Galactic bulge is characteristic for a strongly boxy/peanut-shaped bulge within a barred galaxy.},

@article{Bastian:2014rw,
	Abstract = {Scenarios that invoke multiple episodes of star formation within young globular clusters (GCs) to explain the observed chemical and photometric anomalies in GCs require that clusters can retain the stellar ejecta of the stars within them and accrete large amounts of gas from their surroundings. Hence, it should be possible to find young massive clusters in the local Universe that contain significant amounts (>10 per cent) of the cluster mass of gas and/or dust within them. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with masses in excess of 104 M&sun; and ages between 30 and ˜300 Myr should contain such gas reservoirs. We have searched for H I gas within 12 LMC (and 1 Small Magellanic Cloud) clusters and also for dust using Spitzer 70 and 160 mum images. No clusters were found to contain gas and/or dust. While two of the clusters have H I at the same (projected) position and velocity, the gas does not appear to be centred on the clusters, but rather part of nearby clouds or filaments, suggesting that the gas and cluster are not directly related. This lack of gas (<1 per cent of the stellar mass) is in strong tension with model predictions, and may be due to higher stellar feedback than has been previously assumed or due to the assumptions used in the previous calculations.},

@article{Fujii:2016lq,
	Abstract = {Recent observations have revealed a variety of young star clusters, including embedded systems, young massive clusters, and associations. We study the formation and dynamical evolution of these clusters using a combination of simulations and theoretical models. Our simulations start with a turbulent molecular cloud that collapses under its own gravity. The stars are assumed to form in the densest regions in the collapsing cloud after an initial free-fall time of the molecular cloud. The dynamical evolution of these stellar distributions is continued by means of direct N-body simulations. The molecular clouds typical of the Milky Way Galaxy tend to form embedded clusters that evolve to resemble open clusters. The associations were initially considerably more clumpy, but they lost their irregularity in about a dynamical timescale, due to the relaxation process. The densest molecular clouds, which are absent in the Milky Way but are typical in starburst galaxies, form massive, young star clusters. They indeed are rare in the Milky Way. Our models indicate a distinct evolutionary path from molecular clouds to open clusters and associations or to massive star clusters. The mass-radius relation for both types of evolutionary tracks excellently matches the observations. According to our calculations, the time evolution of the half-mass-radius relation for open clusters and associations follows {r}{{h}}/{{pc}}=2.7{({t}{{age}}/{{pc}})}2/3, whereas for massive star clusters {r}{{h}}/{{pc}}=0.34{({t}{{age}}/{{Myr}})}2/3. Both trends are consistent with the observed age-mass-radius relation for clusters in the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {Context. Machine-Learning (ML) solves problems by learning patterns from data, with limited or no human guidance. In Astronomy, it is mainly applied to large observational datasets, e.g. for morphological galaxy classification. Aims. We apply ML to gravitational N-body simulations of star clusters that are either formed by merging two progenitors or evolved in isolation, planning to later identify Globular Clusters (GCs) that may have a history of merging from observational data. Methods. We create mock-observations from simulated GCs, from which we measure a set of parameters (also called features in the machine-learning field). After dimensionality reduction on the feature space, the resulting datapoints are fed to various classification algorithms. Using repeated random subsampling validation we check whether the groups identified by the algorithms correspond to the underlying physical distinction between mergers and monolithically evolved simulations. Results. The three algorithms we considered (C5.0 trees, k-nearest neighbour, and support-vector machines) all achieve a test misclassification rate of about 10% without parameter tuning, with support-vector machines slightly outperforming the others. The first principal component of feature space correlates with cluster concentration. If we exclude it from the regression, the performance of the algorithms is only slightly reduced.},

	Abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) have central stellar mass surface densities exceeding $10^{4} M_{\odot} pc^{-2}$. It is currently unknown whether the stars formed at such high (proto)stellar densities. We compile a sample of gas clouds in the Galaxy which have sufficient gas mass within a radius of a few parsecs to form a YMC, and compare their radial gas mass distributions to the stellar mass distribution of Galactic YMCs. We find that the gas in the progenitor clouds is distributed differently than the stars in YMCs. The mass surface density profiles of the gas clouds are generally shallower than the stellar mass surface density profiles of the YMCs, which are characterised by prominent dense core regions with radii ~ 0.1 pc, followed by a power-law tail. On the scale of YMC core radii, we find that there are no known clouds with significantly more mass in their central regions when compared to Galactic YMCs. Additionally, we find that models in which stars form from very dense initial conditions require surface densities that are generally higher than those seen in the known candidate YMC progenitor clouds. Our results show that the quiescent, less evolved clouds contain less mass in their central regions than in the highly star-forming clouds. This suggests an evolutionary trend in which clouds continue to accumulate mass towards their centres after the onset of star formation. We conclude that a conveyor-belt scenario for YMC formation is consistent with the current sample of Galactic YMCs and their progenitor clouds.},

	Abstract = {We present a new geometrical method aimed at determining the members of open clusters. The methodology estimates, in an N-dimensional space, the membership probabilities by means of the distances between every star and the cluster central overdensity. It can handle different sets of variables, which have to satisfy the simple condition of being more densely distributed for the cluster members than for the field stars (as positions, proper motions, radial velocities and/or parallaxes are). Unlike other existing techniques, this fact makes the method more flexible and so can be easily applied to different datasets. To quantify how the method identifies the cluster members, we design series of realistic simulations recreating sky regions in both position and proper motion subspaces populated by clusters and field stars. The results, using different simulated datasets (N = 1, 2 and 4 variables), show that the method properly recovers a very high fraction of simulated cluster members, with a low number of misclassified stars. To compare the goodness of our methodology, we also run other existing algorithms on the same simulated data. The results show that our method has a similar or even better performance than the other techniques. We study the robustness of the new methodology from different subsamplings of the initial sample, showing a progressive deterioration of the capability of our method as the fraction of missing objects increases. Finally, we apply all the methodologies to the real cluster NGC 2682, indicating that our methodology is again in good agreement with preceding studies.},

	Abstract = {We present temporal scattering measurements of single pulses and average profiles of PSR J1745-2900, a magnetar recently discovered only 3 arcsec away from Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), from 1.2 to 18.95 GHz using the Effelsberg 100 m Radio Telescope, the Nan{\c c}ay Decimetric Radio Telescope, and the Jodrell Bank Lovell Telescope. Single pulse analysis shows that the integrated pulse profile above 2 GHz is dominated by pulse jitter, while below 2 GHz the pulse profile shape is dominated by scattering. This is the first object in the Galactic center (GC) with both pulse broadening and angular broadening measurements. We measure a pulse broadening time scale at 1 GHz of tau1GHz = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.2 and pulse broadening spectral index of alpha = -3.8 $\pm$ 0.2, which is several orders of magnitude lower than predicted by the NE2001 model (Cordes & Lazio 2002). If this scattering time scale is representative of the GC as a whole, then previous surveys should have detected many pulsars. The lack of detections implies either our understanding of scattering in the GC is incomplete or there are fewer pulsars in the GC than previously predicted. Given that magnetars are a rare class of radio pulsar, there are likely many canonical and millisecond pulsars in the GC, and not surprisingly, scattering in the GC is spatially complex.},

	Abstract = {The pulsed radio emission from the Galactic Center (GC) pulsar SGR J1745-29 probes the turbulent, magnetized plasma of the GC hyperstrong scattering screen through both angular and temporal broadening. We present measurements of the angular size of SGR J1745-29, obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array and the phased Very Large Array at 8.7 and 15.4 GHz. The source sizes are consistent with the scatter-broadened size of Sagittarius A* at each frequency, demonstrating that SGR J1745-29 is also located behind the same scattering medium. Combining the angular broadening with temporal scattering obtained from pulsar observations provides a complete picture of the scattering properties. A best-fit solution for the distance of a single thin screen is Delta = 5.8 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc, consistent with being located in the Scutum spiral arm. The scattering is also consistent with a uniform scattering medium or a series of thin screens distributed between the GC and the Earth. This result is a substantial revision of the previously held model in which the scattering screen is located very close to the GC. As also discussed in Spitler et al., these results suggest that GC searches can detect millisecond pulsars gravitationally bound to Sgr A* with observations at >~ 10 GHz and ordinary pulsars at even lower frequencies.},

	Abstract = {We examine the cosmic evolution of a stellar initial mass function (IMF) in galaxies that varies with the Jeans mass in the interstellar medium, paying particular attention to the K-band stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/LK) of present-epoch massive galaxies. We calculate the typical Jeans mass using high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations coupled with a fully radiative model for the interstellar medium (ISM), which yields a parametrization of the IMF characteristic mass as a function of galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We then calculate the star formation histories of galaxies utilizing an equilibrium galaxy growth model coupled with constraints on the star formation histories set by abundance matching models. We find that at early times, energetic coupling between dust and gas drives warm conditions in the ISM, yielding bottom-light/top-heavy IMFs associated with large ISM Jeans masses for massive star-forming galaxies. Owing to the remnants of massive stars that formed during the top-heavy phases at early times, the resultant M/LK(sigma) in massive galaxies at the present epoch is increased relative to the non-varying IMF case. At late times, lower cosmic ray fluxes allow for cooler ISM temperatures in massive galaxies, and hence newly formed clusters will exhibit bottom-heavy IMFs, further increasing M/LK(sigma). Our central result is hence that a given massive galaxy may go through both top-heavy and bottom-heavy IMF phases during its lifetime, though the bulk of the stars form during a top-heavy phase. Qualitatively, the variations in M/LK(sigma) with galaxy mass are in agreement with observations; however, our model may not be able to account for bottom-heavy mass functions as indicated by stellar absorption features.},

	Abstract = {Multi-aperture photometry of Comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 was conducted on Johnson-Cousins R-band observations spanning 2011 May 1-9 and 2012 June 6-July 3. The comet was observed in outburst on 2011 May 3 and 2012 July 1, during which its brightness increased by 2.2 and 2.1 mag, respectively, as measured through a 10 arcsec aperture. Dust production before and after each outburst is calculated using the parameter Af rho, which is converted to a lower limit on the dust production rate based on dust models and derived nuclear properties from other studies. Both outbursts are accompanied by large increases in dust production, Af rho by a factor of ~6.5-7 and dust production rate by a factor of ~18-23. In addition, variations in the dust brightness profile of the coma are examined during the events. The profile is observed to steepen significantly at the beginning of each outburst and then slowly return to pre-outburst values, mirroring the behavior of Af rho. The start of an outbound "ripple" of dust in the profile might be observed as the comet returns to its pre-outburst state, although this cannot be confirmed. Using a simple model of the 2011 May 3 outburst, an estimated lower limit of (2.6 $\pm$ 0.7) × 108 kg of dust was released during the event. If this is representative of a typical outburst of 29P, then it is estimated that outbursts account for a lower limit of 80^{+20}_{-30}% of the total material ejected by the comet per year.},

	Abstract = {We present a quantitative analysis of the low-resolution (~4.5 {\AA}) spectra of 12 late-B and early-A blue supergiants (BSGs) in the metal-poor dwarf galaxy NGC 3109. A modified method of analysis is presented which does not require use of the Balmer jump as an independent T eff indicator, as used in previous studies. We determine stellar effective temperatures, gravities, metallicities, reddening, and luminosities, and combine our sample with the early-B-type BSGs analyzed by Evans et al. to derive the distance to NGC 3109 using the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relation (FGLR). Using primarily Fe-group elements, we find an average metallicity of [\bar{Z}] = -0.67 $\pm$ 0.13, and no evidence of a metallicity gradient in the galaxy. Our metallicities are higher than those found by Evans et al. based on the oxygen abundances of early-B supergiants ([\bar{Z}] = -0.93 $\pm$ 0.07), suggesting a low alpha/Fe ratio for the galaxy. We adjust the position of NGC 3109 on the BSG-determined galaxy mass-metallicity relation accordingly and compare it to metallicity studies of H II regions in star-forming galaxies. We derive an FGLR distance modulus of 25.55 $\pm$ 0.09 (1.27 Mpc) that compares well with Cepheid and tip of the red giant branch distances. The FGLR itself is consistent with those found in other galaxies, demonstrating the reliability of this method as a measure of extragalactic distances.},

	Abstract = {At a projected distance of ~26 pc from Sgr A*, the Arches cluster provides insight into star formation in the extreme Galactic center (GC) environment. Despite its importance, many key properties, such as the cluster's internal structure and orbital history, are not well known. We present an astrometric and photometric study of the outer region of the Arches cluster (R > 6."25) using Hubble Space Telescope WFC3IR. Using proper motions, we calculate membership probabilities for stars down to F153M = 20 mag (~2.5 M&sun;) over a 120" × 120" field of view, an area 144 times larger than previous astrometric studies of the cluster. We construct the radial profile of the Arches to a radius of 75" (~3 pc at 8 kpc), which can be well described by a single power law. From this profile we place a 3sigma lower limit of 2.8 pc on the observed tidal radius, which is larger than the predicted tidal radius (1--2.5 pc). Evidence of mass segregation is observed throughout the cluster, and no tidal tail structures are apparent along the orbital path. The absence of breaks in the profile suggests that the Arches has not likely experienced its closest approach to the GC between ~0.2 and 1 Myr ago. If accurate, this constraint indicates that the cluster is on a prograde orbit and is located in front of the sky plane that intersects Sgr A*. However, further simulations of clusters in the GC potential are required to interpret the observed profile with more confidence.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the optical spectral region of spectra of ˜1000 stars searching for initial mass function (IMF)-sensitive features to constrain the low-mass end of the IMF slope in elliptical galaxies. The use of indicators bluer than near-infrared features (NaI, CaT, Wing-Ford FeH) is crucial if we want to compare our observations to optical simple stellar population (SSP) models. We use the MILES stellar library (S{\'a}nchez-Bl{\'a}zquez et al.) in the wavelength range 3500-7500 {\AA} to select indices that are sensitive to cool dwarf stars and that do not or only weakly depend on age and metallicity. We find several promising indices of molecular TiO and CaH lines. In this wavelength range, the response of a change in the effective temperature of the cool red giant (RGB) population is similar to the response of a change in the number of dwarf stars in the galaxy. We therefore investigate the degeneracy between IMF variation and DeltaTeff, RGB, and show that it is possible to break this degeneracy with the new IMF indicators defined here. In particular, we define a CaH1 index around lambda6380 {\AA} that arises purely from cool dwarfs, does not strongly depend on age and is anticorrelated with [alpha/Fe]. This index allows the determination of the low-mass end of the IMF slope from integrated-light measurements when combined with different TiO lines and age- and metallicity-dependent features such as Hbeta, Mgb, Fe5270 and Fe5335. The use of several indicators is crucial to break degeneracies between IMF variations, age, abundance pattern and effective temperature of the cool red giant (RGB) population. We measure line-index strengths of our new optical IMF indicators in the Conroy & van Dokkum SSP models and compare these with index strengths of the same spectral features in a sample of stacked Sloan Digital Sky Survey early-type galaxy spectra with varying velocity dispersions. Using different indicators, we find a clear trend of a steepening IMF with increasing velocity dispersion from 150 to 310 km s-1 described by the linear equation x = (2.3 $\pm$ 0.1) log sigma200 + (2.13 $\pm$ 0.15), where x is the IMF slope and sigma200 is the central stellar velocity dispersion measured in units of 200 km s-1. We test the robustness of this relation by repeating the analysis with 10 different sets of indicators. We found that the NaD feature has the largest impact on the IMF slope, if we assume solar [Na/Fe] abundance. By including NaD, the slope of the linear relation increases by 0.3 (2.6 $\pm$ 0.2). We compute the `IMF mismatch' parameter as the ratio of stellar mass-to-light ratio predicted from the x-sigma200 relation to that inferred from SSP models assuming a Salpeter IMF and find good agreement with independent published results.},

@article{Madau:2014ty,
	Abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic ``dark ages'' to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ˜1% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

	Abstract = {We review current theories for the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with particular focus on the extent to which the IMF can be considered universal across various environments. To place the issue in an observational context, we summarize the techniques used to determine the IMF for different stellar populations, the uncertainties affecting the results, and the evidence for systematic departures from universality under extreme circumstances. We next consider theories for the formation of prestellar cores by turbulent fragmentation and the possible impact of various thermal, hydrodynamic, and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities. We address the conversion of prestellar cores into stars and evaluate the roles played by different processes:  competitive accretion, dynamical fragmentation, ejection and starvation, filament fragmentation and filamentary accretion flows, disk formation and fragmentation, critical scales imposed by thermodynamics, and magnetic braking. We present explanations for the characteristic shapes of the present-day prestellar core mass function (CMF) and the IMF and consider what significance can be attached to their apparent similarity. Substantial computational advances have occurred in recent years, and we review the numerical simulations that have been performed to predict the IMF directly and discuss the influence of dynamics, time-dependent phenomena, and initial conditions.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained membership probabilities of stars within a field of radius $\sim3^\circ$ around the centre of the open cluster Alpha Persei using proper motions and photometry from the PPMXL and WISE catalogues. We have identified 810 possible stellar members of Alpha Persei. We derived the global and radial present-day mass function (MF) of the cluster and found that they are well matched by two-stage power-law relations with different slopes at different radii. The global MF of Alpha Persei shows a turnover at $m=0.62\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ with low and high-mass slopes of $\alpha_\mathrm{low}=0.50\pm0.09$ ($0.1<m/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}<0.62$) and $\alpha_\mathrm{high}=2.32\pm0.14$ ($0.62\leq m/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}<4.68$) respectively. The high-mass slope of the cluster increases from $2.01$ inside $1\hbox{$.\!\!^\circ$}10$ to $2.63$ outside $2\hbox{$.\!\!^\circ$}2$, whereas the mean stellar mass decreases from $0.95$ to $0.57\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in the same regions, signifying clear evidence of mass segregation in the cluster. From an examination of the high-quality colour-magnitude data of the cluster and performing a series of Monte Carlo simulations we obtained a binary fraction of $f_{\rm bin}=34\pm12$ percent for stars with $0.70<m/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}<4.68$. This is significantly larger than the observed binary fraction, indicating that this open cluster contains a large population of unresolved binaries. Finally, we corrected the mass-function slopes for the effect of unresolved binaries and found low- and high-mass slopes of $\alpha_\mathrm{low}=0.89\pm0.11$ and $\alpha_\mathrm{high}=2.37\pm0.09$ and a total cluster mass of $352\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$.},

	Abstract = {Fragmentation and fission of giant molecular clouds occasionally results in a pair of gravitationally bound star clusters that orbit their mutual centre of mass for some time, under the influence of internal and external perturbations. We investigate the evolution of binary star clusters with different orbital configurations, with a particular focus on the Galactic tidal field. We carry out $N$-body simulations of evolving binary star clusters and compare our results with estimates from our semi-analytic model. The latter accounts for mass loss due to stellar evolution and two-body relaxation, and for evolution due to external tides. Using the semi-analytic model we predict the long-term evolution for a wide range of initial conditions. It accurately describes the global evolution of such systems, until the moment when a cluster merger is imminent. $N$-body simulations are used to test our semi-analytic model and also to study additional features of evolving binary clusters, such as the kinematics of stars, global cluster rotation, evaporation rates, and the cluster merger process. We find that the initial orientation of a binary star cluster with respect to the Galactic field, and also the initial orbital phase, are crucial for its fate. Depending on these properties, the binaries may experience orbital reversal, spiral-in, or vertical oscillation about the Galactic plane before they actually merge at $t\approx100$~Myr, and produce rotating star clusters with slightly higher evaporation rates. The merger process of a binary cluster induces an outburst that ejects $\sim10\%$ of the stellar members into the Galactic field.},

@article{Sirianni:2005zr,
	Abstract = {We present the photometric calibration of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The ACS was installed in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 2002 March. It comprises three cameras: the Wide Field Channel (WFC), optimized for deep near-IR survey imaging programs; the High Resolution Channel (HRC), a high-resolution imager that fully samples the HST point-spread function (PSF) in the visible; and the Solar Blind Channel (SBC), a far-UV imager. A significant amount of data has been collected to characterize the on-orbit performance of the three channels. We give here an overview of the performance and calibration of the two CCD cameras (WFC and HRC) and a description of the best techniques for reducing ACS CCD data. The overall performance is as expected from prelaunch testing of the camera. Surprises were a better-than-predicted sensitivity in the visible and near-IR for both the WFC and HRC and an unpredicted dip in the HRC UV response at ~3200 {\AA}. On-orbit observations of spectrophotometric standard stars have been used to revise the prelaunch estimate of the instrument response curves to best match predicted and observed count rates. Synthetic photometry has been used to determine zero points for all filters in three magnitude systems and to derive interstellar extinction values for the ACS photometric systems. Due to the CCD internal scattering of long-wavelength photons, the width of the PSF increases significantly in the near-IR, and the aperture correction for photometry with near-IR filters depends on the spectral energy distribution of the source. We provide a detailed recipe to correct for the latter effect. Transformations between the ACS photometric systems and the UBVRI and WFPC2 systems are presented. In general, two sets of transformations are available: one based on the observation of two star clusters; the other on synthetic photometry. We discuss the accuracy of these transformations and their sensitivity to details of the spectra being transformed. Initial signs of detector degradation due to the HST radiative environment are already visible. We discuss the impact on the data in terms of dark rate increase, charge transfer inefficiency, and ``hot'' pixel population.},

	Abstract = {We present first results from a high resolution multi-band survey of the Westerlund 2 region with the Hubble Space Telescope. Specifically, we imaged Westerlund 2 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys through the F555W, F814W, and F658N filters and with the Wide Field Camera 3 in the F125W, F160W, and F128N filters. We derive the first high resolution pixel-to-pixel map of the color excess E{(B-V)}{{g}} of the gas associated with the cluster, combining the Halpha (F658N) and Pabeta (F128N) line observations. We demonstrate that, as expected, the region is affected by significant differential reddening with a median of E{(B-V)}{{g}}=1.87 mag. After separating the populations of cluster members and foreground contaminants using a (F814W-F160W) versus F814W color--magnitude diagram, we identify a pronounced pre-main-sequence population in Westerlund 2 showing a distinct turn-on. After dereddening each star of Westerlund 2 individually in the color--magnitude diagram we find via over-plotting PARSEC isochrones that the distance is in good agreement with the literature value of ~ 4.16+/- 0.33 kpc. With zero-age main sequence fitting to two-color-diagrams, we derive a value of total to selective extinction of {R}V=3.95+/- 0.135. A spatial density map of the stellar content reveals that the cluster might be composed of two clumps. We estimate the same age of 0.5--2.0 Myr for both clumps. While the two clumps appear to be coeval, the northern clump shows a ~ 20% lower stellar surface density.},

The structure of the book is as follows. The first two chapters begin with a discussion of observational techniques, and the basic phenomenology they reveal. The goal is to familiarize students with the basic techniques that will be used throughout, and to provide a common vocabulary for the rest of the book. The next five chapters provide a similar review of the basic physical processes that are important for star formation. Again, the goal is to provide a basis for what follows. The remaining chapters discuss star formation over a variety of scales, starting with the galactic scale and working down to the scales of individual stars and their disks. The book concludes with a brief discussion of the clearing of disks and the transition to planet formation. The book includes five problem sets, complete with solutions.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the circumstellar disc fraction as determined from L-band excess observations of the young, massive Arches and Quintuplet clusters residing in the central molecular zone of the Milky Way. The Quintuplet cluster was searched for L-band excess sources for the first time. We find a total of 26 excess sources in the Quintuplet cluster, and 21 sources with L-band excesses in the Arches cluster, of which 13 are new detections. With the aid of proper motion membership samples, the disc fraction of the Quintuplet cluster could be derived for the first time to be 4.0 $\pm$ 0.7%. There is no evidence for a radially varying disc fraction in this cluster. In the case of the Arches cluster, a disc fraction of 9.2 $\pm$ 1.2% approximately out to the cluster's predicted tidal radius, r< 1.5 pc, is observed. This excess fraction is consistent with our previously found disc fraction in the cluster in the radial range 0.3 <r< 0.8 pc. In both clusters, the host star mass range covers late A- to early B-type stars, 2 <M< 15 M&sun;, as derived from J-band photospheric magnitudes. We discuss the unexpected finding of dusty circumstellar discs in these UV intense environments in the context of primordial disc survival and formation scenarios of secondary discs. We consider the possibility that the L-band excess sources in the Arches and Quintuplet clusters could be the high-mass counterparts to T Tauri pre-transitional discs. As such a scenario requires a long pre-transitional disc lifetime in a UV intense environment, we suggest that mass transfer discs in binary systems are a likely formation mechanism for the B-star discs observed in these starburst clusters.

	Abstract = {Photometry of the integrated Halpha emission in a large sample of field spiral and irregular galaxies has been used to obtain quantitative estimates of the total star formation rate (SFR) in the galaxies. The photoionization properties of a stellar population have been modeled for a variety of choices for the initial mass function (IMF). Excellent agreement with the observed galaxy colors and Halpha emission is obtained with models using an IMF slope close  to Salpeter's original value. The extinction-corrected star formation rates are large, as high as 20 M_sun; yr-1 in giant Sc galaxies. The current rates in late-type galaxies are comparable to the past rates averaged over the age of the disk. Little evidence is found for a strong correlation between the SFR  and average gas density. Comparison of the present SFRs with the remaining supply of interstellar gas yields consumption time scales of only a few times 109 years in most cases.},

	Abstract = {We combined sensitive near-infrared data obtained with ground-based imagers on the ESO NTT and VLT telescopes with space mid-infrared data acquired with the IRAC imager on the Spitzer Space Telescope to calculate the extinction law Alambda/AKs as a function of lambda between 1.25 and 7.76 mum to an unprecedented depth in Barnard 59, a star-forming, dense core located in the Pipe Nebula. The ratios Alambda/AKs were calculated from the slopes of the distributions of sources in color-color diagrams lambda-Ks versus H-Ks. The distributions in the color-color diagrams are fit well with single slopes to extinction levels of AKs~7 (AV~59 mag). Consequently, there appears to be no significant variation of the extinction law with depth through the B59 line of sight. However, when slopes are translated into the relative extinction coefficients Alambda/AKs, we find an extinction law that departs from the simple extrapolation of the near-infrared power-law extinction curve, and agrees more closely with a dust extinction model for a cloud with a total to selective absorption RV=5.5 and a grain size distribution favoring larger grains than those in the diffuse interstellar medium. Thus, the difference we observe could possibly be due to the effect of grain growth in denser regions. Finally, the slopes in our diagrams are somewhat less steep than those from the study of Indebetouw et al. for clouds with lower column densities, and this indicates that the extinction law between 3 and 8 mum might vary slightly as a function of environment.},

@article{Hopkins:2013oz,
	Abstract = {We use a recently developed analytic model for the interstellar medium (ISM) structure from scales of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) through star-forming cores to explore how the pre-stellar core mass function (CMF) and, by extrapolation, stellar initial mass function (IMF) should depend on both local and galactic properties. If the ISM is supersonically turbulent, the statistical properties of the density field follow from the turbulent velocity spectrum, and the excursion set formalism can be applied to analytically calculate the mass function of collapsing cores on the smallest scales on which they are self-gravitating (non-fragmenting). Two parameters determine the model: the disc-scale Mach number {M}h (which sets the shape of the CMF) and the absolute velocity/surface density (to assign an absolute scale). We show that, for normal variation in disc properties and gas temperatures in cores in the Milky Way and local galaxies, there is almost no variation in the high-mass behaviour of the CMF/IMF. The slope is always close to Salpeter down to ≲ 1 M&sun;. We predict modest variation in the sub-solar regime, mostly from variation in {M}h, but this is consistent with the ˜1sigma observed scatter in sub-solar IMFs in local regions. For fixed global (galaxy) properties, there is little variation in shape or `upper mass limit' with parent GMC mass or density. However, in extreme starbursts - ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and merging galaxy nuclei - we predict a bottom-heavy CMF. This agrees well with the IMF recently inferred for the centres of Virgo ellipticals, believed to have formed in such a process. The CMF is bottom heavy despite the gas temperature being an order of magnitude larger, because {M}h is also much larger. Larger {M}h values make the `parent' cloud mass (the turbulent Jeans mass) larger, but promote fragmentation to smaller scales (set by the sonic mass, not the Jeans mass); this shifts the turnover mass and also steepens the slope of the low-mass CMF. The model may also predict a top-heavy CMF for the in situ star formation in the sub-pc disc around Sgr A*, but the relevant input parameters are uncertain.},

	Abstract = {Context. The Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopy of some 100 000 Milky Way stars using the FLAMES spectrograph at the VLT, down to V = 19 mag, systematically covering all the main components of the Milky Way and providing the first homogeneous overview of the distributions of kinematics and chemical element abundances in the Galaxy. Observations of young open clusters, in particular, are giving new insights into their initial structure, kinematics, and their subsequent evolution.  Aims: This paper describes the analysis of UVES and GIRAFFE spectra acquired in the fields of young clusters whose population includes pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. The analysis is applied to all stars in such fields, regardless of any prior information on membership, and provides fundamental stellar atmospheric parameters, elemental abundances, and PMS-specific parameters such as veiling, accretion, and chromospheric activity.  Methods: When feasible, different methods were used to derive raw parameters (e.g. line equivalent widths) fundamental atmospheric parameters and derived parameters (e.g. abundances). To derive some of these parameters, we used methods that have been extensively used in the past and new ones developed in the context of the Gaia-ESO survey enterprise. The internal precision of these quantities was estimated by inter-comparing the results obtained by these different methods, while the accuracy was estimated by comparison with independent external data, such as effective temperature and surface gravity derived from angular diameter measurements, on a sample of benchmarks stars. A validation procedure based on these comparisons was applied to discard spurious or doubtful results and produce recommended parameters. Specific strategies were implemented to resolve problems of fast rotation, accretion signatures, chromospheric activity, and veiling.  Results: The analysis carried out on spectra acquired in young cluster fields during the first 18 months of observations, up to June 2013, is presented in preparation of the first release of advanced data products. These include targets in the fields of the rho Oph, Cha I, NGC 2264, gamma Vel, and NGC 2547 clusters. Stellar parameters obtained with the higher resolution and larger wavelength coverage from UVES are reproduced with comparable accuracy and precision using the smaller wavelength range and lower resolution of the GIRAFFE setup adopted for young stars, which allows us to provide stellar parameters with confidence for the much larger GIRAFFE sample. Precisions are estimated to be ≈120 K rms in Teff, ≈0.3 dex rms in log g, and ≈0.15 dex rms in [Fe/H] for the UVES and GIRAFFE setups.},

	Abstract = {We use photometry in the F220W, F250W, F330W, F435W filters from the High Resolution Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys and photometry in the F555W, F675W, and F814W filters from the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope to derive individual stellar reddenings and extinctions for stars in the HD 97950 cluster in the giant HII region NGC 3603. The mean line-of-sight reddening for about a hundred main-sequence member stars inside the cluster is $E(F435W-F555W)=1.33\pm0.12$ mag. After correcting for foreground reddening, the total to selective extinction ratio is $R_{F555W}=3.75\pm0.87$ in the cluster. Within the standard deviation associated with $E(\rm \lambda-F555W)/E(F435W-F555W)$ in each filter, the cluster extinction curve at ultraviolet wavelengths tends to be greyer than the average Galactic extinction laws from Cardelli et al. (1989) and Fitzpatrick et al. (1999). It is closer to the extinction law derived by Calzetti et al. (2000) for starburst galaxies, where the 0.2175 $\rm \mu m$ bump is absent. This indicates an anomalous extinction in the HD 97950 cluster, which may due to the clumpy dust distribution within the cluster, and the size of dust grains being larger than the average Galactic ISM.},

	Abstract = {The distributions of stars and prestellar cores by mass (initial and dense core mass functions, IMF/DCMF) stay among the key factors regulating star formation and are subject of detailed theoretical and observational studies. Results from numerical simulations of star formation qualitatively resemble an observed mass function, a scale free power law with a sharp decline at low masses. However, most analytic IMF theories critically depend on the empirically chosen input spectrum of mass fluctuations which evolve into dense cores and, subsequently, stars. Here we propose a new approach exploiting the techniques from the field of network science. We represent a system of dense cores accreting gas from the surrounding diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) as a spatial network growing by preferential attachment and assume that the ISM density has a self-similar fractal distribution following the Kolmogorov turbulence theory. As opposed to gravoturbulent fragmentation theories, we consider the dense core growth and demonstrate that the power law core mass function emerges independently of the initial distribution of density fluctuations by mass. Our model yields a power law solely defined by the fractal dimensionalities of the ISM and accreting gas. With a proper choice of the low mass cut-off, it reproduces observations over three decades in mass. We also rule out a low mass star dominated ``bottom-heavy'' IMF in a single star forming region.},

	Abstract = {The parameterized extinction data of Fitzpatrick and Massa (1986, 1988) for the ultraviolet and various sources for the optical and near-infrared are used to derive a meaningful average extinction law over the 3.5 micron to 0.125 wavelength range which is applicable to both diffuse and dense regions of the interstellar medium. The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations. The validity of the law over a large wavelength interval suggests that the processes which modify the sizes and compositions of grains are stochastic in nature and very efficient.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of the SDSS APOGEE INfrared Spectroscopy of Young Nebulous Clusters program (IN-SYNC) survey of the Orion A molecular cloud. This survey obtained high resolution near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of about 2700 young pre-main sequence stars throughout the region, acquired across five distinct fields spanning 6deg field of view (FOV). With these spectra, we have measured accurate stellar parameters (T_eff, log g, v sin i) and extinctions, and placed the sources in the Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram (HRD). We have also extracted radial velocities for the kinematic characterization of the population. We compare our measurements with literature results for a sub-sample of targets in order to assess the performances and accuracy of the survey. Source extinction shows evidence for dust grains that are larger than those in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM): we estimate an average R_V=5.5 in the region. Importantly, we find a clear correlation between HRD inferred ages and spectroscopic surface-gravity inferred ages. This clearly indicates a real spread of stellar radii at fixed temperature, and together with additional correlations with extinction and with disk presence, strongly suggests a real spread of ages large than a few Myr. Focussing on the young population around NGC1980 iota Ori, which has previously been suggested to be a separate, foreground, older cluster, we confirm its older (5Myr) age and low A_V, but considering that its radial velocity distribution is indistinguishable from the Orion A's population, we suggest that NGC1980 is part of Orion A's star formation activity. Based on their stellar parameters and kinematic properties, we identify 383 new candidate members of Orion A, most of which are diskless sources in areas of the region poorly studied by previous works.},

	Abstract = {We explore the long-term evolution of the anisotropy in the velocity space of star clusters starting with different structural and kinematical properties. We show that the evolution of the radial anisotropy strength and its radial variation within a cluster contain distinct imprints of the cluster initial structural properties, dynamical history, and of the external tidal field of its host galaxy. Initially isotropic and compact clusters with small initial values of the ratio of the half-mass to Jacobi radius, $r_h/r_J$, develop a strong radial anisotropy during their long-term dynamical evolution. Many clusters, if formed with small values of $r_h/r_J$, should now be characterized by a significant radial anisotropy increasing with the distance from the cluster centre, reaching its maximum at a distance between 0.2 $r_J$ and 0.4 $r_J$, and then becoming more isotropic or mildly tangentially anisotropic in the outermost regions. A similar radial variation of the anisotropy can also result from an early violent relaxation phase. In both cases, as a cluster continues its evolution and loses mass, the anisotropy eventually starts to decrease and the system evolves toward an isotropic velocity distribution. However, in order to completely erase the strong anisotropy developed by these compact systems during their evolution, they must be in the advanced stages of their evolution and lose a large fraction of their initial mass. Clusters that are initially isotropic and characterized by larger initial values of $r_h/r_J$, on the other hand, never develop a significant radial anisotropy.},

	Abstract = {Dynamical mass calculations have suggested that the Milky Way globular cluster NGC 6535 belongs to a population of clusters with high mass-to-light ratios, possibly due to a bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function. We use published Hubble Space Telescope data to measure the present day stellar mass function of this cluster within its half-light radius and instead find that it is bottom-light, exacerbating the discrepancy between the dynamical measurement and its known stellar content. The cluster's proximity to the Milky Way bulge and its relatively strong velocity anisotropy are both reasons to be suspicious of the dynamical mass measurement, but we find that neither straightforwardly explains the sense and magnitude of the discrepancy. Although there are alternative potential explanations for the high mass-to-light ratio, such as the presence of large numbers of stellar remnants or dark matter, we find this cluster to be sufficiently perplexing that we now exclude it from a discussion of possible variations in the initial mass function. Because this was the sole known old, Milky Way cluster in the population of high dynamical mass-to-light ratio clusters, some possible explanations for the difference in cluster properties are again open for consideration.},

	Abstract = {We use a combination of data acquired with the Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope and the Large Binocular Camera (LBC-blue) mounted on the Large Binocular Telescope, to sample the main sequence stars of the globular cluster NGC~5466 in the mass range $0.3<M/M_\odot<0.8$. We derive the cluster's Luminosity Function in several radial regions, from the center of the cluster out to the tidal radius. After corrections for incompleteness and field-contamination, this has been compared to theoretical Luminosity Functions, obtained by multiplying a simple power law Mass Function in the form dN/dm$ \propto m^{\alpha}$ by the derivative of the mass-luminosity relationship of the best-fit isochrone. We find that $\alpha$ varies from -0.6 in the core region to -1.9 in the outer region. This fact allows us to observationally prove that the stars in NGC 5466 have experienced the effects of mass segregation. We compare the radial variation of $\alpha$ from the center out to 5 core radii (r$_c$) in NGC 5466 and the globular cluster M10, finding that the gradient of $\alpha$ in the first 5r$_c$ is more than a factor of 2 shallower in NGC 5466 than in M10, in line with the differences in the clusters' relaxation timescales. NGC 5466 is dynamically younger than M10, with two-body relaxation processes only recently starting to shape the distribution of main sequence stars. This result fully agrees with the conclusion obtained in our previous works on the radial distribution of Blue Straggler Stars, further confirming that this can be used as an efficient clock to measure the dynamical age of stellar systems.},

	Abstract = {Context. The fraction of binary stars is an important ingredient to interpret globular cluster dynamical evolution and their stellar population.  Aims: We investigate the properties of main-sequence binaries measured in a uniform photometric sample of 59 Galactic globular clusters that were observed by HST WFC/ACS as a part of the Globular Cluster Treasury project.  Methods: We measured the fraction of binaries and the distribution of mass-ratio as a function of radial location within the cluster, from the central core to beyond the half-mass radius. We studied the radial distribution of binary stars, and the distribution of stellar mass ratios. We investigated monovariate relations between the fraction of binaries and the main parameters of their host clusters.  Results: We found that in nearly all the clusters, the total fraction of binaries is significantly smaller than the fraction of binaries in the field, with a few exceptions only. Binary stars are significantly more centrally concentrated than single MS stars in most of the clusters studied in this paper. The distribution of the mass ratio is generally flat (for mass-ratio parameter q > 0.5). We found a significant anti-correlation between the binary fraction in a cluster and its absolute luminosity (mass). Some, less significant correlation with the collisional parameter, the central stellar density, and the central velocity dispersion are present. There is no statistically significant relation between the binary fraction and other cluster parameters. We confirm the correlation between the binary fraction and the fraction of blue stragglers in the cluster.  Tables 1-3 and Appendices are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {Most star clusters at an intermediate age (1-2 Gyr) in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds show a puzzling feature in their color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) that is not in agreement with a simple stellar population. The main sequence turn-off of these clusters is much broader than would be expected from photometric uncertainties. One interpretation of this feature is that age spreads of the order 200-500 Myr exist within individual clusters, although this interpretation is highly debated. Such large age spreads should affect other parts of the CMD, which are sensitive to age, as well. In this study, we analyze the CMDs of a sample of 12 intermediate-age clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud that all show an extended turn-off using archival optical data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. We fit the star formation history of the turn-off region and the red clump region independently with two different theoretical isochrone models. We find that in most of the cases, the age spreads inferred from the red clumps are smaller than the ones resulting from the turn-off region. However, the age ranges resulting from the red clump region are broader than would be expected for a single age. Only two out of 12 clusters in our sample show a red clump which seems to be consistent with a single age. As our results are not unambiguous, we can not ultimately tell if the extended main sequence turn-off feature is due to an age spread, or not, by fitting the star formation histories to the red clump regions. However, we find that the width of the extended main sequence turn-off feature is correlated with the age of the clusters in a way which would be unexplained in the "age spread" interpretation, but which may be expected if stellar rotation is the cause of the spread at the turn-off.},

	Abstract = {Context. Only a small number of high mass stars (>30 M&sun;) have fundamental parameters (i.e. masses and radii) measured with high enough accuracy from eclipsing binaries to constrain formation and evolutionary models of massive stars.  Aims: This work aims to increase this limited sample, by studying the four massive eclipsing binary candidates discovered by Bonanos in the young massive cluster Westerlund 1.  Methods: We present new follow-up echelle spectroscopy of these binaries and models of their light and radial velocity curves.  Results: We obtain fundamental parameters for the eight component stars, finding masses that span a range of 10-40 M&sun;, and contributing accurate fundamental parameters for one additional very massive star, the 33 M&sun; component of W13. WR77o is found to have a ~40 M&sun; companion, which provides a second dynamical constraint on the mass of the progenitor of the magnetar known in the cluster. We also use W13 to estimate the first, direct, eclipsing binary distance to Westerlund 1 and therefore the magnetar and find it to be at 3.7 $\pm$ 0.6 kpc.  Conclusions: Our results confirm previous evidence for a high mass for the progenitor of the magnetar. In addition, the availability of eclipsing binaries with accurate parameters opens the way for direct, independent, high precision eclipsing binary distance measurements to Westerlund 1.},

	Abstract = {We present new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the young Galactic open cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1) that reveal a unique population of massive evolved stars. We identify ~200 cluster members and present spectroscopic classifications for ~25% of these. We find that all stars so classified are unambiguously post-Main Sequence objects, consistent with an apparent lack of an identifiable Main Sequence in our photometric data to V˜ 20. We are able to identify rich populations of Wolf Rayet stars, OB supergiants and short lived transitional objects. Of these, the latter group consists of both hot (Luminous Blue Variable and extreme B supergiant) and cool (Yellow Hypergiant and Red Supergiant) objects - we find that half the known Galactic population of YHGs resides within Wd 1. We obtain a mean V-MV ~ 25 mag from the cluster Yellow Hypergiants, implying a Main Sequence turnoff at or below MV =-5 (O7 V or later). Based solely on the masses inferred for the 53 spectroscopically classified stars, we determine an absolute minimum mass of ~1.5 × 10^3~M&sun; for Wd 1. However, considering the complete photometrically and spectroscopically selected cluster population and adopting a Kroupa IMF we infer a likely mass for Wd 1 of ~10^5~M&sun;, noting that inevitable source confusion and incompleteness are likely to render this an underestimate. As such, Wd 1 is the most massive compact young cluster yet identified in the Local Group, with a mass exceeding that of Galactic Centre clusters such as the Arches and Quintuplet. Indeed, the luminosity, inferred mass and compact nature of Wd 1 are comparable with those of Super Star Clusters - previously identified only in external galaxies - and is consistent with expectations for a Globular Cluster progenitor.},

@article{Negueruela:2010hc,
	Abstract = {Context. After leaving the main sequence, massive stars undergo complex evolution, a process that is still poorly understood. With a population of hundreds of OB stars, the starburst cluster Westerlund 1 offers an unparallelled environment to study their evolutionary tracks.  Aims: We characterise a large sample of evolved OB stars in the cluster, with the aim of determining cluster parameters and place stars in an evolutionary sequence.  Methods: We used the FORS2 instrument on the VLT to obtain intermediate-resolution spectroscopy over the range 5800-9000 {\AA} of about a hundred stars selected as likely members of the cluster based on their photometry. We developed criteria for their spectral classification using only spectral features in the range observed. We discuss these criteria, useful for spectral classification of early-type stars in the GAIA spectral region, in the appendix. Using these criteria, we obtain spectral classifications, probably accurate to one subtype, for 57 objects, most of which had no previous classification or a generic classification.  Results: We identify more than 50 objects as OB supergiants. We find almost 30 luminous early-B supergiants and a number of less luminous late-O supergiants. In addition, we find a few mid B supergiants with very high luminosity, some of them displaying signs of heavy mass loss. All these stars form a sequence compatible with theoretical evolutionary tracks. In addition, two early B supergiants also show indication of heavy mass loss and may represent the evolutionary phase immediately prior to the Wolf-Rayet stage. We investigate cluster properties using the spectral types and existing photometry. We find that the reddening law to the cluster does not deviate strongly from standard, even though extinction is quite variable, with an average value AV=10.8. Though evolutionary tracks for high-mass stars are subject to large uncertainties, our data support an age of ⪆5 Myr and a distance d≈5~kpc for Westerlund 1.  Conclusions: The spectral types observed are compatible with a single burst of star formation (the age range is very unlikely to be >1 Myr). Westerlund 1 shows its potentiality as a laboratory for massive star evolution, which can be fulfilled by detailed study of the population presented here.

	Abstract = {The Orion Nebula cluster (ONC) appears to be unusual on two grounds: the observed constellation of the OB stars of the entire ONC and its Trapezium at its centre implies a time-scale problem given the age of the Trapezium, and an initial mass function (IMF) problem for the whole OB star population in the ONC. Given the estimated crossing time of the Trapezium, it ought to have totally dynamically decayed by now. Furthermore, by combining the lower limit of the ONC mass with a standard IMF it emerges that the ONC should have formed at least about 40 stars heavier than 5 Msolar while only 10 are observed. Using the N-body experiments we (i) confirm the expected instability of the Trapezium and (ii) show that beginning with a compact OB-star configuration of about 40 stars both the number of observed OB stars after 1 Myr within 1 pc radius and a compact trapezium configuration can be reproduced. These two empirical constraints thus support our estimate of 40 initial OB stars in the cluster. Interestingly, a more-evolved version of the ONC resembles the Upper Scorpius OB association. The N-body experiments are performed with the new C-code CATENA by integrating the equations of motion using the chain-multiple-regularization method. In addition, we present a new numerical formulation of the IMF.},

	Abstract = {A promising mechanism to form intermediate-mass black holes is the runaway merger in dense star clusters, where main-sequence stars collide and form a very massive star (VMS), which then collapses to a black hole (BH). In this paper, we study the effects of primordial mass segregation and the importance of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) on the runaway growth of VMSs using a dynamical Monte Carlo code for N-body systems with N as high as 106 stars. Our code now includes an explicit treatment of all stellar collisions. We place special emphasis on the possibility of top-heavy IMFs, as observed in some very young massive clusters. We find that both primordial mass segregation and the shape of the IMF affect the rate of core collapse of star clusters and thus the time of the runaway. When we include primordial mass segregation, we generally see a decrease in core-collapse time (t cc). Although for smaller degrees of primordial mass segregation this decrease in t cc is mostly due to the change in the density profile of the cluster, for highly mass-segregated (primordial) clusters, it is the increase in the average mass in the core which reduces the central relaxation time decreasing t cc. The final mass of the VMS formed is always close to ~10-3 of the total cluster mass, in agreement with previous studies and is reminiscent of the observed correlation between the central BH mass and the bulge mass of the galaxies. As the degree of primordial mass segregation is increased, the mass of the VMS increases at most by a factor of three. Flatter IMFs generally increase the average mass in the whole cluster, which increases t cc. For the range of IMFs investigated in this paper, this increase in t cc is to some degree balanced by stellar collisions, which accelerate core collapse. Thus, there is no significant change in t cc for the somewhat flatter global IMFs observed in very young massive clusters.},

In this paper we formulate parametrized models of mass segregated star clusters in virial equilibrium. To this purpose we introduce mean interparticle potentials for statistically described unsegregated systems and suggest a single-parameter generalization of its form which gives a mass segregated state.

	Abstract = {Recently, De Marchi, Paresce & Pulone studied a sample of 20 globular clusters and found that all clusters with high concentrations have steep stellar mass functions while clusters with low concentration have comparatively shallow mass functions. No globular clusters were found with a flat mass function and high concentration. This seems curious since more concentrated star clusters are believed to be dynamically more evolved and should have lost more low-mass stars via evaporation, which would result in a shallower mass function in the low-mass part.  We show that this effect can be explained by residual-gas expulsion from initially mass segregated star clusters, and is enhanced further through unresolved binaries. If gas expulsion is the correct mechanism to produce the observed trend in the c-alpha-plane, then observation of these parameters would allow to constrain cluster starting conditions such as star formation efficiency and the time-scale of gas expulsion.},

The ESO Public Survey VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) discovered several new clusters hosting massive stars. We present an analysis of massive stars in four of these new clusters. Our aim is to provide constraints on stellar evolution and to better understand the relation between different types of massive stars. We use the radiative transfer code CMFGEN to analyse K-band spectra of twelve stars with spectral types ranging from O and B to WN and WC. We derive the stellar parameters of all targets as well as surface abundances for a subset of them. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the Wolf-Rayet stars are more luminous or hotter than the O stars. From the log(C/N) - log(C/He) diagram, we show quantitatively that WN stars are more chemically evolved than O stars, WC stars being more evolved than WN stars. Mass loss rates among Wolf-Rayet stars are a factor of 10 larger than for O stars, in agreement with previous findings.},

	Abstract = {Context. The ESO Public Survey "VISTA Variables in the V{\'\i}a L{\'a}ctea" (VVV) provides deep multi-epoch infrared observations for an unprecedented 562 sq. degrees of the Galactic bulge, and adjacent regions of the disk. Nearly 150 new open clusters and cluster candidates have been discovered in this survey.  Aims: This is the second in a series of papers about young, massive open clusters observed using the VVV survey. We present the first study of six recently discovered clusters. These clusters contain at least one newly discovered Wolf-Rayet (WR) star.  Methods: Following the methodology presented in the first paper of the series, wide-field, deep JHKs VVV observations, combined with new infrared spectroscopy, are employed to constrain fundamental parameters for a subset of clusters.  Results: We find that the six studied stellar groups are real young (2-7 Myr) and massive (between 0.8 and 2.2 × 103 M&sun;) clusters. They are highly obscured (AV ~ 5-24 mag) and compact (1-2 pc). In addition to WR stars, two of the six clusters also contain at least one red supergiant star, and one of these two clusters also contains a blue supergiant. We claim the discovery of 8 new WR stars, and 3 stars showing WR-like emission lines which could be classified WR or OIf. Preliminary analysis provides initial masses of ~30-50 M&sun; for the WR stars. Finally, we discuss the spiral structure of the Galaxy using the six new clusters as tracers, together with the previously studied VVV clusters.  Based on observations with ISAAC, VLT, ESO (programme 087.D-0341A), New Technology Telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory (programme 087.D-0490A) and with the Clay telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory (programme CN2011A-086). Also based on data from the VVV survey (programme 172.B-2002).},

	Abstract = {The observed masses of the most massive stars do not surpass about 150 Msolar. This may either be a fundamental upper mass limit which is defined by the physics of massive stars and/or their formation, or it may simply reflect the increasing sparsity of such very massive stars, so that the observation of even higher mass stars becomes unlikely in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. It is shown here that if the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is a power law with a Salpeter exponent (alpha= 2.35) for massive stars then the richest very young cluster R136 seen in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) should contain stars with masses larger than 750 Msolar. If, however, the IMF is formulated by consistently incorporating a fundamental upper mass limit then the observed upper mass limit is arrived at readily even if the IMF is invariant. An explicit down-turn or cut-off of the IMF near 150 Msolar is not required: our formulation of the problem contains this implicitly. We are therefore led to conclude that a fundamental maximum stellar mass near 150 Msolar exists, unless the true IMF has alpha > 2.8.},

	Abstract = {We consider the effect of mass segregation on the observable integrated properties of star clusters. The measurable properties depend on a combination of the dynamical age of the cluster and the physical age of the stars in the cluster. To investigate all possible combinations of these two quantities, we propose an analytical model for the mass function of segregated star clusters that agree with the results of N-body simulations, in which any combination can be specified. For a realistic degree of mass segregation and a fixed density profile, we find with increasing age an increase in the measured core radii and a central surface brightness which decreases in all filters more rapidly than what is expected from stellar evolution alone. Within a gigayear, the measured core radius increases by a factor of 2 and the central surface density in all filters of a segregated cluster will be overestimated by a similar factor if mass segregation is not taken into account during the conversion from light to mass. We find that the V-I colour of mass-segregated clusters decreases with radius by about 0.1-0.2 mag, which could be observable. From recent observations of partially resolved extragalactic clusters, a decreasing half-light radius with increasing wavelength was observed, which was attributed to mass segregation. These observations cannot be reproduced by our models. In addition, we provide physical arguments based on the evolution of individual stars that one should not expect strong dependence of core radius as a function of the wavelength. We find that the differences between measured radii in different filters are always smaller than 5 per cent.},

	Abstract = {We examine the performance of four different methods which are used to measure mass segregation in star-forming regions: the radial variation of the mass function {M}_MF; the minimum spanning tree-based LambdaMSR method; the local surface density SigmaLDR method; and the OmegaGSR technique, which isolates groups of stars and determines whether the most massive star in each group is more centrally concentrated than the average star. All four methods have been proposed in the literature as techniques for quantifying mass segregation, yet they routinely produce contradictory results as they do not all measure the same thing. We apply each method to synthetic star-forming regions to determine when and why they have shortcomings. When a star-forming region is smooth and centrally concentrated, all four methods correctly identify mass segregation when it is present. However, if the region is spatially substructured, the OmegaGSR method fails because it arbitrarily defines groups in the hierarchical distribution, and usually discards positional information for many of the most massive stars in the region. We also show that the LambdaMSR and SigmaLDR methods can sometimes produce apparently contradictory results, because they use different definitions of mass segregation. We conclude that only LambdaMSR measures mass segregation in the classical sense (without the need for defining the centre of the region), although SigmaLDR does place limits on the amount of previous dynamical evolution in a star-forming region.},

	Abstract = {By analysing models of the young massive cluster R136 in 30 Doradus, set-up using the herewith introduced and publicly made available code MCLUSTER, we investigate and compare different methods for detecting and quantifying mass segregation and substructure in non-seeing limited N-body data. For this purpose we generate star cluster models with different degrees of mass segregation and fractal substructure and analyse them.  We quantify mass segregation by measuring, from the projected 2D model data, the mass function slope in radial annuli, by looking for colour gradients in radial colour profiles, by measuring Allison's Lambda parameter and by determining the local stellar surface density around each star. We find that these methods for quantifying mass segregation often produce ambiguous results. Most reliable for detecting mass segregation is the mass function slope method, whereas the colour-gradient method is the least practical in an R136-like configuration. The other two methods are more sensitive to low degrees of mass segregation but are computationally much more demanding. We also discuss the effect of binaries on these measures.  Moreover, we quantify substructure by looking at the projected radial stellar density profile, by comparing projected azimuthal stellar density profiles and by determining Cartwright & Whitworth's Q parameter. We find that only high degrees of substructure affect the projected radial density profile, whereas the projected azimuthal density profile is very sensitive to substructure. The Q parameter is also sensitive to substructure but its absolute value shows a dependence on the radial density gradient of the cluster and is strongly influenced by binaries.  Thus, in terms of applicability and comparability for large sets of N-body data, the mass function slope method and the azimuthal density profile method seem to be the best choices for quantifying the degree of mass segregation and substructure, respectively. The other methods are computationally too demanding to be practically feasible for large data sets.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the dissolution of initially mass-segregated and unsegregated star clusters due to two-body relaxation in external tidal fields, using Aarseth's collisional N-body code NBODY4 on GRAPE6 special-purpose computers. When extrapolating results of initially non-mass-segregated models to globular clusters, we obtain a correlation between the time until destruction and the slope of the mass function, in the sense that globular clusters that are closer to dissolution are more strongly depleted in low-mass stars. This correlation fits observed mass functions of most globular clusters. The mass functions of several globular clusters are, however, more strongly depleted in low-mass stars than is suggested by these models. Such strongly depleted mass functions can be explained if globular clusters started initially mass segregated. Primordial mass segregation also explains the correlation between the slope of the stellar mass function and the cluster concentration that was recently discovered by De Marchi and coworkers. In this case, it is possible that all globular clusters started with a mass function similar to that seen in young open clusters in the present-day universe, at least for stars below m=0.8 Msolar. This argues for a near universality of the mass function for different star formation environments and metallicities in the range -2<[Fe/H]<0. We finally describe a novel algorithm that can initialize stationary mass-segregated clusters with an arbitrary density profile and amount of mass segregation.},

@article{Banerjee:2015cq,
	Abstract = {The classic question that how young massive star clusters attain their shapes and sizes, as we find them today, remains to be a challenge. Both observational and computational studies of star-forming massive molecular gas clouds infer that massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale ($\lesssim0.3$ pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. The present study is intended to investigate the possible ways in which a filament-like-compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can expand $\gtrsim10$ times, still remaining massive enough ($\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$), to become a young massive star cluster, as we observe today. To that end, model massive clusters (of initially $10^4 M_\odot-10^5 M_\odot$) are evolved using Sverre Aarseth's state-of-the-art N-body code NBODY7. All the computed clusters expand with time, whose sizes (effective radii) are compared with those observed for young massive clusters, of age $\lesssim100$ Myr, in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. It is found that beginning from the above compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand by its own, i.e., due to two-body relaxation, stellar-evolutionary mass loss, dynamical heating by primordial binaries and stellar-mass black holes, up to the observed sizes of young massive clusters; they always remain much more compact compared to the observed ones. This calls for additional mechanisms that can boost the expansion of a massive cluster after its assembly. Using further N-body calculations, it is shown that a substantial residual gas expulsion, with $\approx30$% star formation efficiency, can indeed swell the newborn embedded cluster adequately. The limitations of the present calculations and their consequences are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We study the evolution of star clusters on circular and eccentric orbits using direct $N$-body simulations. We model clusters with initially $N=8{\rm k}$ and $N=16{\rm k}$ single stars of the same mass, orbiting around a point-mass galaxy. For each orbital eccentricity that we consider, we find the apogalactic radius at which the cluster has the same lifetime as the cluster with the same $N$ on a circular orbit. We show that then, the evolution of bound particle number and half-mass radius is approximately independent of eccentricity. Secondly, when we scale our results to orbits with the same semi-major axis, we find that the lifetimes are, to first order, independent of eccentricity. When the results of Baumgardt and Makino for a singular isothermal halo are scaled in the same way, the lifetime is again independent of eccentricity to first order, suggesting that this result is independent of the Galactic mass profile. From both sets of simulations we empirically derive the higher order dependence of the lifetime on eccentricity. Our results serve as benchmark for theoretical studies of the escape rate from clusters on eccentric orbits. Finally, our results can be useful for generative models for cold streams and cluster evolution models that are confined to spherical symmetry and/or time-independent tides, such as Fokker-Planck models, Monte Carlo models, and (fast) semi-analytic models.},

	Abstract = {Characterization of the binary fractions in star clusters is of fundamental importance for many fields in astrophysics. Observations indicate that the majority of stars are found in binary systems, while most stars with masses greater than $0.5 M_\odot$ are formed in star clusters. In addition, since binaries are on average more massive than single stars, in resolved star clusters these systems are thought to be good tracers of (dynamical) mass segregation. Over time, dynamical evolution through two-body relaxation will cause the most massive objects to migrate to the cluster center, while the relatively lower-mass objects remain in or migrate to orbits at greater radii. This process will globally dominate a cluster's stellar distribution. However, close encounters involving binary systems may disrupt `soft' binaries. This process will occur more frequently in a cluster's central, dense region than in its periphery, which may mask the effects of mass segregation. Using high resolution Hubble Space Telescope observations, combined with sophisticated $N$-body simulations, we investigate the radial distributions of the main-sequence binary fractions in massive young Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters. We show that binary disruption may play an important role on very short timescales, depending on the environmental conditions in the cluster cores. This may lead to radial binary fractions that initially decline in the cluster centers, which is contrary to the effects expected from dynamical mass segregation.},

	Abstract = {Context. In recent years new observations of pre-main sequence stars (pre-MS) with Z <= Z&sun; have been made available. To take full advantage of the continuously growing amount of data of pre-MS stars in different environments, we need to develop updated pre-MS models for a wide range of metallicity to assign reliable ages and masses to the observed stars.  Aims: We present updated evolutionary pre-MS models and isochrones for a fine grid of mass, age, metallicity, and helium values.  Methods: We use a standard and well-tested stellar evolutionary code (i.e. FRANEC), that adopts outer boundary conditions from detailed and realistic atmosphere models. In this code, we incorporate additional improvements to the physical inputs related to the equation of state and the low temperature radiative opacities essential to computing low-mass stellar models.  Results: We make available via internet a large database of pre-MS tracks and isochrones for a wide range of chemical compositions (Z = 0.0002-0.03), masses (M = 0.2-7.0 M&sun;), and ages (1-100 Myr) for a solar-calibrated mixing length parameter alpha (i.e. 1.68). For each chemical composition, additional models were computed with two different mixing length values, namely alpha = 1.2 and 1.9. Moreover, for Z >= 0.008, we also provided models with two different initial deuterium abundances. The characteristics of the models have been discussed in detail and compared with other work in the literature. The main uncertainties affecting theoretical predictions have been critically discussed. Comparisons with selected data indicate that there is close agreement between theory and observation.  Tracks and isochrones are available on the web at the http://astro.df.unipi.it/stellar-models/Tracks and isochrones are also available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/533/A109},

	Abstract = {We perform a series of direct $N$-body calculations to investigate the effect of residual gas expulsion from the gas-embedded progenitors of present-day globular clusters (GCs) on the stellar mass function (MF). Our models start either tidally filling or underfilling, and either with or without primordial mass segregation. We cover 100 Myr of the evolution of modeled clusters and show that the expulsion of residual gas from initially mass-segregated clusters leads to a significantly shallower slope of the stellar MF in the low- ($m\leq 0.50 M_\odot$) and intermediate-mass ($\simeq 0.50-0.85 M_\odot$) regime. Therefore, the imprint of residual gas expulsion and primordial mass segregation might be visible in the present-day MF. We find that the strength of the external tidal field, as an essential parameter, influences the degree of flattening, such that a primordially mass-segregated tidally-filling cluster with $r_h/r_t\geq 0.1$ shows a strongly depleted MF in the intermediate stellar mass range. Therefore, the shape of the present-day stellar MF in this mass range probes the birth place of clusters in the Galactic environment. We furthermore find that this flattening agrees with the observed correlation between the concentration of a cluster and its MF slope, as found by de Marchi et al.. We show that if the expansion through the residual gas expulsion in primordial mass segregated clusters is the reason for this correlation then GCs most probably formed in strongly fluctuating local tidal fields in the early proto-Milky Way potential, supporting the recent conclusion by Marks \& Kroupa.},

@article{okas:2013hc,
	Abstract = {We present a phenomenological description of the properties of tidal tails forming around dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way. For this purpose we use collisionless N-body simulations of dwarfs initially composed of a disc embedded in an NFW dark matter halo. The dwarfs are placed on seven orbits around the Milky Way like host, differing in size and eccentricity, and their evolution is followed for 10 Gyr. In addition to the well-studied morphological and dynamical transformation of the dwarf's main body, the tidal stripping causes them to lose a substantial fraction of mass both in dark matter and in stars which form pronounced tidal tails. We focus on the properties of the stellar component of the tidal tails thus formed. We first discuss the break radii in the stellar density profile defining the transition to tidal tails as the radii where the profile becomes shallower and relate them to the classically defined tidal radii. We then calculate the relative density and velocity of the tails at a few break radii as a function of the orbital phase. Next, we measure the orientation of the tails with respect to an observer placed at the centre of the Milky Way. The tails are perpendicular to this line of sight only for a short period of time near the pericentre. For most of the time the angles between the tails and this line of sight are low, with orbit-averaged medians below 42$\,^{\circ}$ for all, even the almost circular orbit. The median angle is typically lower while the maximum relative density higher for more eccentric orbits. The combined effects of relative density and orientation of the tails suggest that they should be easiest to detect for dwarf galaxies soon after their pericentre passage.},

We derive a revised expression for the tidal radius of a rotating satellite which properly takes into account the possibility of prograde and retrograde orbits of stars. Besides the eccentricity of the satellite orbit, the tidal radius depends also on the ratio of the satellite internal angular velocity to the orbital angular velocity. We compare our formula to the results of two $N$-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting a Milky Way-like host on a prograde and retrograde orbit. The tidal radius for the retrograde case is larger than for the prograde. We introduce a kinematic radius separating stars still orbiting the dwarf galaxy from those already stripped and following the potential of the host galaxy. We find that the tidal radius matches very well the kinematic radius.},

A valid initial mass function (IMF) is desirable in order to gain the capability of tracking the chemical evolution and abundances of stars and galaxies. Several parameterized versions of the IMF are discussed and illustrated with examples. The field star IMF is introduced for estimating the stellar mass function by determining the frequency distribution of luminosities for field stars in the solar neighborhood. The distribution is converted into a distribution of masses by means of a mass-luminosity relation and corrected for stars that have died over the history of the galactic disk. The results are applied to the solar neighborhood, compared with calculations using other models, and then extended to calculating IMFs for star clusters, nearby galaxies, and chemical distributions within galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We study the evolution and observability of young compact star clusters within ~200 pc of the Galactic center. Calculations are performed using direct N-body integration on the GRAPE-4, including the effects of both stellar and binary evolution and the external influence of the Galaxy. The results of these detailed calculations are used to calibrate a simplified model applicable over a wider range of cluster initial conditions. We find that clusters within 200 pc of the Galactic center dissolve within ~70 Myr. However, their projected densities drop below the background density in the direction of the Galactic center within ~20 Myr, effectively making these clusters undetectable after that time. Clusters farther from the Galactic center but at the same projected distance are more strongly affected by this selection effect and may go undetected for their entire lifetimes. Based on these findings, we conclude that the region within 200 pc of the Galactic center could easily harbor some 50 clusters with properties similar to those of the Arches or the Quintuplet systems.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the structural change and degree of mass segregation of young dense star clusters within about 100 pc of the Galactic center. In our calculations, which are performed with GRAPE-6, the equations of motion of all stars and binaries are calculated accurately but the external potential of the Galaxy is solved (semi)analytically.  The simulations are performed to model the Arches star cluster.  We find that star clusters with are less strongly perturbed by the tidal field and dynamical friction are much stronger affected by mass segregation; resulting in a significant pile-up of massive stars in the cluster center. At an age of about 3.5 Myr more than 90 per cent of the stars more massive than ˜ 10 M&sun;  are concentrated within the half-mass radius of the surviving cluster.  Star clusters which are strongly perturbed by the tidal field of the parent Galaxy are much less affected by mass segregation.},

	Abstract = {We present results from dynamical Monte Carlo simulations of dense star clusters near the Galactic center. These clusters sink toward the center of the Galaxy by dynamical friction. During their in-spiral, they may undergo core collapse and form an intermediate-mass black hole through runaway collisions. Such a cluster can then reach within a parsec of the Galactic center before it completely disrupts, releasing many young stars in this region. This scenario provides a natural explanation for the presence of the young stars observed near the Galactic center. Here we determine the initial conditions for this scenario to work, and we derive the mass distribution of cluster stars as a function of distance from the Galactic center. For reasonable initial conditions, we find that clusters massive enough for rapid in-spiral would include a larger number of massive stars (m*>~30Msolar) than currently observed in the in-spiral region. We point out several possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy.},

	Abstract = {We use direct N-body simulations to study the in-spiral and internal evolution of dense star clusters near the Galactic center. These clusters sink toward the center owing to dynamical friction with the stellar background and may go into core collapse before being disrupted by the Galactic tidal field. If a cluster reaches core collapse before disruption, its dense core, which has become rich in massive stars, survives to reach close to the Galactic center. When it eventually dissolves, the cluster deposits a disproportionate number of massive stars in the innermost parsec of the Galactic nucleus. Comparing the spatial distribution and kinematics of the massive stars with observations of IRS 16, a group of young He I stars near the Galactic center, we argue that this association may have formed in this way.},

@article{Kim:2003bl,
	Abstract = {Numerical simulations of the dynamical friction suffered by a star cluster near the Galactic center have been performed with a parallelized tree code. Gerhard has suggested that dynamical friction, which causes a cluster to lose orbital energy and spiral in toward the Galactic center, may explain the presence of a cluster of very young stars in the central parsec, where star formation might be prohibitively difficult because of strong tidal forces. The clusters modeled in our simulations have an initial total mass of 105-106 Msolar and initial Galactocentric radii of 2.5-30 pc. We have identified a few simulations in which dynamical friction indeed brings a cluster to the central parsec, although this is only possible if the cluster either is very massive (~106 Msolar) or is formed near the central parsec (<~5 pc). In both cases, the cluster should have an initially very dense core (>106 Msolar pc-3). The initial core collapse and segregation of massive stars into the cluster core, which typically happens on a much shorter timescale than that characterizing the dynamical inspiral of the cluster toward the Galactic center, can provide the requisite high density. Furthermore, because it is the cluster core that is most likely to survive the cluster disintegration during its journey inward, this can help account for the observed distribution of presumably massive He I stars in the central parsec.},

The results confirm the membership of the three sub-populations with different iron abudances discovered in the system. The orbit of the system has been derived from a first estimate of its absolute proper motion, obtained by using bulge stars as reference. The results of the integration of this orbit within an axisymmetric Galactic model exclude any external accretion origin for this cluster. Terzan 5 is known to have chemistry similar to the Galactic bulge; our findings support a kinematic link between the cluster and the bulge, further strengthening the possibility that Terzan 5 is the fossil remnant of one of the pristine clumps that originated the bulge.},

We find that depends on the ratio , where rh is the half-mass radius and rJ the radius of the zero-velocity surface around the cluster. For , the `tidal regime', there is almost no dependence of on . To first order this is because the fraction of escapers per half-mass relaxation time, trh, scales approximately as , which cancels out the r3/2h term in trh. For , the `isolated regime', scales as . The dissolution time-scale, tdis, falls in three regimes. Clusters that start with their initial , in the tidal regime dissolve completely in this regime and their tdis is, therefore, insensitive to the initial rh. Our model predicts that has to be 10-20-10-10 for clusters to dissolve completely in the isolated regime. This means that realistic clusters that start with always expand to the tidal regime before final dissolution. Their tdis has a shallower dependence on than what would be expected when tdis is a constant times trh. For realistic values of , the lifetime varies by less than a factor of 1.5 due to changes in . This implies that the `survival' or `vital' diagram for globular clusters should allow for more small clusters to survive. We note that with our result it is impossible to explain the universal peaked mass function of globular cluster systems by dynamical evolution from a power-law initial mass function, since the peak will be at lower masses in the outer parts of galaxies. Our results finally show that in the tidal regime tdis scales as N0.65/omega, with omega the angular frequency of the cluster in the host galaxy.},

@article{Lutzgendorf:2013bx,
	Abstract = {Context. Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) may provide the missing link to understanding the growth of supermassive black holes in the early Universe. Some formation scenarios predict that IMBHs could have formed by runaway collisions in globular clusters (GCs). However, it is challenging to set observational constraints on the mass of a black hole in a largely gas-free (and hence accretion-free) stellar system such as a GC. Understanding the influence of an IMBH in the center of a GC on its environment might provide indirect detection methods.  Aims: Our goal is to test the effects of different initial compositions of GCs on their evolution in a tidal field. We pin down the crucial observables that indicate the presence of an IMBH at the center of the cluster. In addition to central IMBHs, we also consider the effects of different stellar-mass black hole retention and stellar binary fractions.  Methods: We performed a set of 22 N-body simulations and varied particle numbers, IMBH masses, stellar-mass black-hole retention fractions, and stellar binary fractions. These models are all run in an external tidal field to study the effect of black holes on the cluster mass loss, mass function, and life times. Finally, we compared our results with observational data.  Results: We found that a central massive black hole increases the escape rate of high-mass stars from a star cluster, implying that the relative depletion of the mass function at the low-mass end proceeds less rapidly. Furthermore, we found a similar behavior for a cluster hosting a high number of stellar-mass black holes instead of one massive central IMBH. The presence of an IMBH also weakly affects the fraction of the cluster mass that is constituted by stellar remnants, as does the presence of primordial binaries. We compared our simulations with observational data from the literature and found good agreement between our models and observed mass functions and structural parameters of GCs. We exploited this agreement to identify GCs that could potentially host IMBHs.},

	Abstract = {Direct N-body simulations of globular clusters in a realistic Milky-Way-like potential are carried out using the code NBODY6 to determine the impact of the host galaxy disk mass and geometry on the survival of star clusters. A relation between disk mass and star-cluster dissolution timescale is derived. These N-body models show that doubling the mass of the disk from 5 × 1010 M &sun; to 10 × 1010 M &sun; halves the dissolution time of a satellite star cluster orbiting the host galaxy at 6 kpc from the galactic center. Different geometries in a disk of identical mass can determine either the survival or dissolution of a star cluster orbiting within the inner 6 kpc of the galactic center. Furthermore, disk geometry has measurable effects on the mass loss of star clusters up to 15 kpc from the galactic center. N-body simulations performed with a fine output time step show that at each disk crossing the outer layers of star clusters experiences an increase in velocity dispersion of ~5% of the average velocity dispersion in the outer section of star clusters. This leads to an enhancement of mass loss---a clearly discernable effect of disk shocking. By running models with different inclinations, we determine that star clusters with an orbit that is perpendicular to the Galactic plane have larger mass loss rates than do clusters that evolve in the Galactic plane or in an inclined orbit.},

	Abstract = {We describe the interplay between stellar evolution and dynamical mass loss of evolving star clusters, based on the principles of stellar evolution and cluster dynamics and on the details of a grid of N-body simulations of Galactic cluster models. The cluster models have different initial masses, different orbits, including elliptical ones, and different initial density profiles. We use two sets of cluster models: one set of Roche lobe filling models and a new set of cluster models that are initially underfilling their tidal radius.  We identify four distinct mass-loss effects: (1) mass loss by stellar evolution, (2) loss of stars induced by stellar evolution and (3) relaxation-driven mass loss before and (4) after core collapse. At young ages the mass loss is dominated by stellar evolution, followed by the evolution-induced loss of stars. This evolution-induced mass loss is important if a cluster is immersed in the tidal field. Both the evolution-induced loss of stars and the relaxation-driven mass loss need time to build up. This is described by a delay function that has a characteristic time-scale of a few crossing times for Roche lobe filling clusters and a few half-mass relaxation times for initially Roche lobe underfilling clusters. The relaxation-driven mass loss (called `dissolution' in this paper) can be described by a simple power-law dependence of the mass d(M/Msolar)/dt = -(M/Msolar)1 - gamma/t0, where t0 depends on the orbit and environment of the cluster. The index gamma is 0.65 for clusters with a King parameter W0 = 5 for the initial density distribution, and 0.80 for more concentrated clusters with W0 = 7. For initially Roche lobe underfilling clusters the dissolution is described by the same gamma = 0.80, independent of the initial density distribution. The values of the constant t0 are derived for the models and described by simple formulae that depend on the orbit of the cluster. The mass-loss rate increases by about a factor of 2 at core collapse and the mass dependence of the relaxation-driven mass loss changes to gamma = 0.70 after core collapse.  We also present a simple recipe for predicting the mass evolution of individual star clusters with various metallicities and in different environments, with an accuracy of a few per cent in most cases. This can be used to predict the mass evolution of cluster systems.},

	Abstract = {Direct N-body simulations of star clusters in a realistic Milky-Way-like potential are carried out using the code NBODY6. Based on these simulations, a new relationship between scale size and galactocentric distance is derived: the scale size of star clusters is proportional to the hyperbolic tangent of the galactocentric distance. The half-mass radius of star clusters increases systematically with galactocentric distance but levels off when star clusters orbit the galaxy beyond ~40 kpc. These simulations show that the half-mass radius of individual star clusters varies significantly as they evolve over a Hubble time, more so for clusters with shorter relaxation times, and remains constant through several relaxation times only in certain situations when expansion driven by the internal dynamics of the star cluster and the influence of the host galaxy tidal field balance each other. Indeed, the radius of a star cluster evolving within the inner 20 kpc of a realistic galactic gravitational potential is severely truncated by tidal interactions and does not remain constant over a Hubble time. Furthermore, the half-mass radius of star clusters measured with present-day observations bears no memory of the original cluster size. Stellar evolution and tidal stripping are the two competing physical mechanisms that determine the present-day size of globular clusters. These simulations also show that extended star clusters can form at large galactocentric distances while remaining fully bound to the host galaxy. There is thus no need to invoke accretion from an external galaxy to explain the presence of extended clusters at large galactocentric distances in a Milky-Way-type galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We have performed N-body simulations of star clusters orbiting in a spherically symmetric smooth galactic potential. The model clusters cover a range of initial half-mass radii and orbital eccentricities in order to test the historical assumption that the tidal radius of a cluster is imposed at perigalacticon. The traditional assumption for globular clusters is that since the internal relaxation time is larger than its orbital period, the cluster is tidally stripped at perigalacticon. Instead, our simulations show that a cluster with an eccentric orbit does not need to fully relax in order to expand. After a perigalactic pass, a cluster recaptures previously unbound stars, and the tidal shock at perigalacticon has the effect of energizing inner region stars to larger orbits. Therefore, instead of the limiting radius being imposed at perigalacticon, it more nearly traces the instantaneous tidal radius of the cluster at any point in the orbit. We present a numerical correction factor to theoretical tidal radii calculated at perigalacticon which takes into consideration both the orbital eccentricity and current orbital phase of the cluster.},

	Abstract = {Context. The expulsion of the unconverted gas at the end of the star formation process potentially leads to the expansion of the just formed stellar cluster and membership loss. The degree of expansion and mass loss depends largely on the star formation efficiency and scales with the mass and size of the stellar group when stellar interactions can be neglected.  Aims: We investigate the circumstances in which stellar interactions between cluster members become so important that the fraction of bound stars after gas expulsion is significantly altered.  Methods: The Nbody6 code is used to simulate the cluster dynamics after gas expulsion for different star formation efficiences. Concentrating on the most massive clusters observed in the Milky Way, we test to what extent the results depend on the model, i.e. stellar mass distribution, stellar density profile etc., and the cluster parameters, such as cluster density and size.  Results: We find that stellar interactions leading to ejections are responsible for up to 20% mass loss in the most compact massive clusters in the Milky Way. Therefore, ejections are the prime mass loss process in these systems. Even in the loosely bound OB associations, stellar interactions are responsible for at least ~5% mass loss. The main reason why the importance of encounters for massive clusters has been largely overlooked is because of the often used approach of a single-mass representation instead of a realistic distribution for the stellar masses. The density dependence on the encounter-induced mass loss is shallower than expected because of the increasing importance of few-body interactions in dense clusters compared to sparse clusters where 2-body encounters dominate.},

@article{Pfalzner:2013eq,
	Abstract = {Context. Most stars form as part of a star cluster. The most massive clusters in the Milky Way exist in two groups - loose and compact clusters - with significantly different sizes at the end of the star formation process. After their formation, both types of clusters expand up to a factor 10-20 within the first 20 Myr of their development. Gas expulsion at the end of the star formation process is usually regarded as the only possible process that can lead to such an expansion during this early period of development.  Aims: We investigate the effect of gas expulsion by a direct comparison between numerical models and observed clusters and concentrate on clusters with masses >103M&sun;. For these clusters the initial conditions before gas expulsion, the characteristic cluster development, its dependence on cluster mass, and the star formation efficiency (SFE) are investigated.  Methods: We performed N-body simulations of the cluster expansion process after gas expulsion and compared the results with observations.  Results: We find that the expansion processes of the observed loose and compact massive clusters are driven by completely different physical processes. As expected, the expansion of loose massive clusters is largely driven by the gas loss due to the low SFE of ~30%. One new revelation is that all the observed massive clusters of this group seem to have a very similar size of 1-3 pc at the onset of expansion. It is demonstrated that compact clusters have a much higher effective SFE of 60-70% and are as a result much less affected by gas expulsion. Their expansion is mainly driven by stellar ejections caused by interactions between the cluster members. The reason ejections are so efficient in driving cluster expansion is that they occur dominantly from the cluster centre and over an extended period of time. During the first 10 Myr the internal dynamics of loose and compact clusters thus differ fundamentally.  Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {We investigate the ratio between the half-mass radii rh of Galactic globular clusters and their Jacobi radii rJ given by the potential of the Milky Way and show that clusters with galactocentric distances RGC > 8 kpc fall into two distinct groups: one group of compact, tidally underfilling clusters with rh/rJ < 0.05 and another group of tidally filling clusters which have 0.1 < rh/rJ < 0.3. We find no correlation between the membership of a particular cluster in one of these groups and its membership in the old or younger halo population. Based on the relaxation times and orbits of the clusters, we argue that compact clusters and most clusters in the inner Milky Way were born compact with half-mass radii rh < 1 pc. Some of the tidally filling clusters might have formed compact as well, but the majority likely formed with large half-mass radii. Galactic globular clusters therefore show a similar dichotomy as was recently found for globular clusters in dwarf galaxies and for young star clusters in the Milky Way. It seems likely that some of the tidally filling clusters are evolving along the main-sequence line of clusters recently discovered by K{\"u}pper et al. (2008) and are in the process of dissolution.},

	Abstract = {We present detailed luminosity profiles of the young massive clusters M82-F, NGC 1569-A and NGC 1705-1 which show significant departures from equilibrium (King and Elson, Fall & Freeman) profiles. We compare these profiles with those from N-body simulations of clusters that have undergone the rapid removal of a significant fraction of their mass as a result of gas expulsion. We show that the observations and simulations agree very well with each other, suggesting that these young clusters are undergoing violent relaxation and are also losing a significant fraction of their stellar mass.  That these clusters are not in equilibrium can explain the discrepant mass-to-light ratios observed in many young clusters with respect to simple stellar population models without resorting to non-standard initial stellar mass functions as claimed for M82-F and NGC 1705-1. We also discuss the effect of rapid gas removal on the complete disruption of a large fraction of young massive clusters (`infant mortality'). Finally, we note that even bound clusters may lose >50 per cent of their initial stellar mass as a result of rapid gas loss (`infant weight-loss').},

	Abstract = {The globular cluster Palomar 5 is remarkable not only because of its extended massive tidal tails, but also for its very low mass and velocity dispersion, and its size, which is much larger than its theoretical tidal radius. In order to understand these extreme properties, we performed more than 1000 N-body simulations of clusters traversing the Milky Way on the orbit of Pal 5. Tidal shocks at disk crossings near perigalacticon dominate the evolution of extended low-concentration clusters, resulting in massive tidal tails and often in a quick destruction of the cluster. The very large size of Pal 5 can be explained as the result of an expansion following the heating induced by the last strong disk shock ~150 Myr ago. Some of the models can reproduce the low observed velocity dispersion and the relative fractions of stars in the tails and between the inner and outer parts of the tails. Our simulations illustrate to what extent the observable tidal tails trace out the orbit of the parent object. The tidal tails of Pal 5 show substantial structure not seen in our simulations. We argue that this structure is probably caused by Galactic substructure, such as giant molecular clouds, spiral arms, and dark matter clumps, which was ignored in our modeling. Clusters initially larger than their theoretical tidal limit remain so, because after being shocked, they settle into a new equilibrium near apogalacticon where they are unaffected by the perigalactic tidal field. This implies that, contrary to previous wisdom, globular clusters on eccentric orbits may well remain supertidally limited and hence vulnerable to strong disk shocks, which dominate their evolution until destruction. Our simulations unambiguously predict the destruction of Pal 5 at its next disk crossing in ~110 Myr. This corresponds to only 1% of the cluster lifetime, suggesting that many more similar systems could once have populated the inner parts of the Milky Way but have been transformed into debris streams by the Galactic tidal field.},

	Abstract = {We present N-body simulations (including an initial mass function) of globular clusters in the Galaxy in order to study effects of the tidal field systematically on the properties of the outer parts of globular clusters. Using NBODY6, which correctly takes into account the two-body relaxation, we investigate the development of tidal tails of globular clusters in the Galactic tidal field. For simplicity, we have employed only the spherical components (bulge and halo) of the Galaxy, and ignored the effects of stellar evolution which could have been important in the very early phase of the cluster evolution. The total number of stars in our simulations is about 20000, which is much smaller than the realistic number of stars. All simulations had been done for several orbital periods in order to understand the development of the tidal tails. In our scaled-down models, the relaxation time is sufficiently short to show the mass segregation effect, but we did not go far enough to see the core collapse, and the fraction of stars lost from the cluster at the end of the simulations is only ~10 per cent. The radial distribution of extra-tidal stars can be described by a power law with a slope around -3 in surface density. The directions of tidal tails are determined by the orbits and locations of the clusters. We find that the length of tidal tails increases towards the apogalacticon and decreases towards the perigalacticon. This is an anti-correlation with the strength of the tidal field, caused by the fact that the time-scale for the stars to respond to the potential is similar to the orbital time-scale of the cluster. The escape of stars in the tidal tails towards the pericentre could be another reason for the decrease of the length of tidal tails. We find that the rotational angular velocity of tidally induced clusters shows quite different behaviour from that of initially rotating clusters.},

@article{Gieles:2008mi,
	Abstract = {Many embedded star clusters do not evolve into long-lived bound clusters. The most popular explanation for this ``infant mortality'' of young (few Myrs) clusters is the expulsion of natal gas by stellar winds and supernovae, which perturbs the clusters' potential and leaves up to 90% of them unbound. A cluster disruption model has recently been proposed in which this mass-independent disruption of clusters proceeds for another Gyr after gas expulsion. In this scenario, the survival chances of massive clusters are much smaller than in the traditional mass-dependent disruption models. The most common way to study cluster disruption is to use the cluster age distribution, which, however, can be heavily affected by incompleteness. To avoid this pitfall we introduce a new method of studying cluster disruption based on size-of-sample effects, namely the relation between the most massive cluster, M_max, and the age range sampled. Assuming that clusters are stochastically sampled from a power-law cluster initial mass function, with index -2 and that the cluster formation rate is constant, M_max scales with the age range sampled, such that the slope in a log(M_max) vs. log(age) plot is equal to unity. This slope decreases if mass-independent disruption is included. For 90% mass-independent cluster disruption per age dex, the predicted slope is zero. For the solar neighbourhood, SMC, LMC, M 33, and M 83, based on ages and masses taken from the literature, we find slopes consistent with the expected size-of-sample correlations for the first 100 Myr, hence ruling out the 90% mass-independent cluster disruption scenario. For M 51, however, the increase of log(M_max) with log(age) is slightly shallower and for the Antennae galaxies it is flat. This simple method shows that the formation and/or disruption of clusters in the Antennae must have been very different from that of the other galaxies studied here, so it should not be taken as a representative case.},

	Abstract = {Clusters are the dense inner regions of a wide-spread hierarchy of young stellar structures. They often reveal a continuation of this hierarchy inside of them, to smaller scales, when they are young, but orbital mixing eventually erases these subparts and only a smooth cluster or smooth unbound group remains. The stellar hierarchy follows a similar structure in the interstellar gas, which is presumably scale-free because of supersonic motions in the presence of turbulence and self-gravity. The efficiency of star formation increases automatically with density in a hierarchical ISM, causing most dense stellar groups to be initially bound for local conditions. In lower pressure environments, the infant mortality rates should be higher. Also following from hierarchical structure is the cluster mass distribution function and perhaps also the cluster size distribution function, although the predicted mass-size relation is not observed. Cluster destruction is from a variety of causes. The destruction time should depend on cluster mass, but the various groups who have studied this dependence have gotten significantly different results so far.},

	Abstract = {Most globular clusters have half-mass radii of a few pc with no apparent correlation with their masses. This is different from elliptical galaxies, for which the Faber-Jackson relation suggests a strong positive correlation between mass and radius. Objects that are somewhat in between globular clusters and low-mass galaxies, such as ultracompact dwarf galaxies, have a mass-radius relation consistent with the extension of the relation for bright ellipticals. Here we show that at an age of 10Gyr a break in the mass-radius relation at ~106Msolar is established because objects below this mass, i.e. globular clusters, have undergone expansion driven by stellar evolution and hard binaries. From numerical simulations we find that the combined energy production of these two effects in the core comes into balance with the flux of energy that is conducted across the half-mass radius by relaxation. An important property of this `balanced' evolution is that the cluster half-mass radius is independent of its initial value and is a function of the number of bound stars and the age only. It is therefore not possible to infer the initial mass-radius relation of globular clusters, and we can only conclude that the present day properties are consistent with the hypothesis that all hot stellar systems formed with the same mass-radius relation and that globular clusters have moved away from this relation because of a Hubble time of stellar and dynamical evolution.},

For many star clusters and galactic nuclei, the time scale on which this occurs is significantly less than the age of the universe. As a result, such systems are expected to be sites of frequent interactions among stars, binary systems and stellar remnants, making them efficient factories for the production of compact binaries, intermediate-mass black holes and other interesting and eminently observable astrophysical exotica. We describe some elements of the competition among stellar dynamics, stellar evolution and other mechanisms to control the dynamics of stellar systems, and discuss briefly the techniques by which these systems are modeled and studied.

	Abstract = {We present N-body simulations of dissolving star clusters close to Galactic Centres. For this purpose, we developed a new N-body program called NBODY6GC based on Aarseth's series of N-body codes. We describe the algorithm in detail. We report about the density wave phenomenon in the tidal arms which has been recently explained by K{\"u}pper, Macleod & Heggie. Standing waves develop in the tidal arms. The wave knots or clumps develop at the position, where the emerging tidal arm hits the potential wall of the effective potential and is reflected. The escaping stars move through the wave knots further into the tidal arms. We show the consistency of the positions of the wave knots with the theory in Just et al. We also demonstrate a simple method to study the properties of tidal arms. By solving many eigenvalue problems along the tidal arms, we numerically construct a one-dimensional coordinate system whose direction is always along a principal axis of the local tensor of inertia. Along this coordinate system, physical quantities can be evaluated. The half-mass or dissolution times of our models are almost independent of the particle number which indicates that two-body relaxation is not the dominant mechanism leading to the dissolution. This may be a typical situation for many young star clusters. We propose a classification scheme which sheds light on the dissolution mechanism.},

The structure of the system, as measured by the core to half-mass radius ratio, also evolves toward a universal state, which is set by the efficiency of heating on the visible population of stars induced by dynamical interactions in the core of the system. Interactions with dark remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and stellar mass black holes) are dominant over the heating induced by a moderate population of primordial binaries (3%-5%), especially under the assumption that most of the neutron stars and black holes are retained in the system. All our models without primordial binaries undergo a deep gravothermal collapse in the radial mass profile. However, their projected light distribution can be well fitted by medium concentration King models (with parameter W 0 ~ 8), even though there tends to be an excess over the best fit for the innermost points of the surface brightness. This excess is consistent with a shallow cusp in the surface brightness (mu ~ R -nu with nu ~ 0.4-0.7), like it has been observed for many globular clusters from high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging. Generally, fitting a King profile to derive the structural parameters yields to larger fluctuations in the core size than defining the core as the radius where the surface brightness is one half of its central value. Classification of core-collapsed globular clusters based on their surface brightness profile may thus fail in systems that appear to have already bounced back to lower concentrations, particularly if the angular resolution of the observations is limited and the core is not well resolved.},

	Abstract = {New opacity distribution functions (ODFs) for several metallicities have been computed. The main improvements upon previous ODFs computed by Kurucz (1990) are: (1) the replacement of the solar abundances from Anders & Grevesse (1989) with those from Grevesse & Sauval (1998); (2) the replacement of the TiO lines provided by Kurucz (1993) with the TiO lines from Schwenke (1998), as distributed by Kurucz (1999a); (3) the addition of the H2O lines from Partridge & Schwenke (1997) as distributed by Kurucz (1999b); (4) the addition of the HI-HI and HI-H+ quasi-molecular absorptions near 1600 A and 1400 A computed according to Allard et al. (1998). Other minor improvements are related with some changes in a few atomic and molecular data. New grids of ATLAS9 model atmospheres for Teff from 3500K to 50000K and logg from 0.0 dex to 5.0 dex have been computed for several metallicities with the new ODFs. Preliminary comparisons of the results from the old and new models have shown differences in the energy distributions of stars cooler than 4500K, in the ultraviolet energy distribution of metal-poor A-type stars, in the U-B and u-b color indices for Teff<7000K and in all the color indices for Teff<4250K.},

	Abstract = {The star formation rate (SFR) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central 500 pc) of the Milky Way is lower by a factor of >=10 than expected for the substantial amount of dense gas it contains, which challenges current star formation theories. In this paper, we quantify which physical mechanisms could be responsible. On scales larger than the disc scaleheight, the low SFR is found to be consistent with episodic star formation due to secular instabilities or possibly variations of the gas inflow along the Galactic bar. The CMZ is marginally Toomre-stable when including gas and stars, but highly Toomre-stable when only accounting for the gas, indicating a low condensation rate of self-gravitating clouds. On small scales, we find that the SFR in the CMZ may be caused by an elevated critical density for star formation due to the high turbulent pressure. The existence of a universal density threshold for star formation is ruled out. The H I-H2 phase transition of hydrogen, the tidal field, a possible underproduction of massive stars due to a bottom-heavy initial mass function, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray or radiation pressure feedback also cannot individually explain the low SFR. We propose a self-consistent cycle of star formation in the CMZ, in which the effects of several different processes combine to inhibit star formation. The rate-limiting factor is the slow evolution of the gas towards collapse - once star formation is initiated it proceeds at a normal rate. The ubiquity of star formation inhibitors suggests that a lowered central SFR should be a common phenomenon in other galaxies. We discuss the implications for galactic-scale star formation and supermassive black hole growth, and relate our results to the star formation conditions in other extreme environments.},

	Abstract = {About 20% of all massive stars in the Milky Way have unusually high velocities, the origin of which has puzzled astronomers for half a century. We argue that these velocities originate from strong gravitational interactions between single stars and binaries in the centers of star clusters. The ejecting binary forms naturally during the collapse of a young (≲1 milion years old) star cluster. This model replicates the key characteristics of OB runaways in our galaxy, and it explains the presence of runaway stars of ≳100 solar masses (M&sun;) around young star clusters, such as R136 and Westerlund 2. The high proportion and the distributions in mass and velocity of runaways in the Milky Way are reproduced if the majority of massive stars are born in dense and relatively low-mass (5000 to 10,000 M&sun;) clusters.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we provide 2189 photometric- and kinematic-selected member candidates of 24 star clusters from the LAMOST DR2 catalog. We perform two-step membership identification: selection along the stellar track in the color-magnitude diagram, i.e., photometric identification, and the selection from the distribution of radial velocities, i.e. the kinematic identification. We find that the radial velocity from the LAMOST data are very helpful in the membership identification. The mean probability of membership is 40\% for the radial velocity selected sample. With these 24 star clusters, we investigate the performance of the radial velocity and metallicity estimated in the LAMOST pipeline. We find that the systematic offset in radial velocity and metallicity are $0.85\pm1.26$\,\kms\ and $-0.08\pm0.04$\,dex, with dispersions of $5.47_{-0.71}^{+1.16}$\,\kms\ and $0.13_{-0.02}^{+0.04}$\,dex, respectively. Finally, we propose that the photometric member candidates of the clusters covered by the LAMOST footprints should be assigned higher priority so that more member stars can be observed.},

	Abstract = {We conduct a theoretical study on the ejection of runaway massive stars from R136---the central massive, starburst cluster in the 30 Doradus complex of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Specifically, we investigate the possibility of the very massive star (VMS) VFTS 682 being a runaway member of R136. Recent observations of the above VMS, by virtue of its isolated location and its moderate peculiar motion, have raised the fundamental question of whether isolated massive star formation is indeed possible. We perform the first realistic N-body computations of fully mass-segregated R136-type star clusters in which all the massive stars are in primordial binary systems. These calculations confirm that the dynamical ejection of a VMS from an R136-like cluster, with kinematic properties similar to those of VFTS 682, is common. Hence, the conjecture of isolated massive star formation is unnecessary to account for this VMS. Our results are also quite consistent with the ejection of 30 Dor 016, another suspected runaway VMS from R136. We further note that during the clusters' evolution, mergers of massive binaries produce a few single stars per cluster with masses significantly exceeding the canonical upper limit of 150 M &sun;. The observations of such single super-canonical stars in R136, therefore, do not imply an initial mass function with an upper limit greatly exceeding the accepted canonical 150 M &sun; limit, as has been suggested recently, and they are consistent with the canonical upper limit.},

	Abstract = {N-body simulations have shown that the dynamical decay of the young (~1 Myr) Orion Nebula cluster could be responsible for the loss of at least half of its initial content of OB stars. This result suggests that other young stellar systems could also lose a significant fraction of their massive stars at the very beginning of their evolution. To confirm this expectation, we used the Mid-Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (completed by the Midcourse Space Experiment satellite) to search for bow shocks around a number of young (⪅several Myr) clusters and OB associations. We discovered dozens of bow shocks generated by OB stars running away from these stellar systems, supporting the idea of significant dynamical loss of OB stars. In this paper, we report the discovery of three bow shocks produced by O-type stars ejected from the open cluster NGC 6611 (M16). One of the bow shocks is associated with the O9.5Iab star HD165319, which was suggested to be one of ``the best examples for isolated Galactic high-mass star formation'' (de Wit et al. 2005, A&A, 437, 247). Possible implications of our results for the origin of field OB stars are discussed.},

We measure radial velocities for HVS candidates with the colors of early A-type and late B-type stars. We report the discovery of six unbound HVSs with velocities and distances exceeding the conservative escape velocity estimate of Kenyon and collaborators. We additionally report four possibly unbound HVSs with velocities and distances exceeding the lower escape velocity estimate of Xue and collaborators. These discoveries increase the number of unbound HVSs by 60%-100%. Other survey objects include 19 newly identified z ~ 2.4 quasars. One of the HVSs may be a horizontal branch star, consistent with the number of evolved HVSs predicted by Galactic center ejection models. Finding more evolved HVSs will one day allow a probe of the low-mass regime of HVSs and will constrain the mass function of stars in the Galactic center.},

	Abstract = {Hyper-velocity stars are believed to be ejected out from the Galactic center through dynamical interactions between (binary) stars and the central massive black hole(s). In this paper, we report 19 low mass F/G/K type hyper-velocity star candidates from over one mil- lion stars of the first data release of the LAMOST general survey. We determine the unbound probability for each candidate using a Monte-Carlo simulation by assuming a non-Gaussian proper-motion error distribution, Gaussian heliocentric distance and radial velocity error dis- tributions. The simulation results show that all the candidates have unbound possibilities over 50% as expected, and one of them may even exceed escape velocity with over 90% probabili- ty. In addition, we compare the metallicities of our candidates with the metallicity distribution functions of the Galactic bulge, disk, halo and globular cluster, and conclude that the Galactic bulge or disk is likely the birth place for our candidates.},

	Abstract = {We present an atlas of 173 synthetic spectra of stars, with mass from 9 to 120 M&sun;, covering the region of the OB main sequence stars in the H-R diagram. The spectra were calculated with the stellar atmosphere code CMFGEN, assuming solar metallicity in the ZAMS. In order to study the effect of rotation on the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere, we calculated two sets of models: with metallicity changed by rotation when the star evolves and maintaining solar metallicity throughout the same evolutionary track. For each model, we calculated its synthetic spectra in the UV (900-2000 {\AA}), optical (3500-7000 {\AA}), and near IR (10,000-30,000 {\AA}). We show the utility of this atlas, obtaining preliminary models for three stars in the field of the VVVCL086 cluster, comparing their IR observed spectra with the ones of the atlas. This process was done in a few hours, while the standard procedure to obtain such models could take several weeks.},

@article{Bertone:2004lk,
	Abstract = {We carried out a critical appraisal of the two theoretical models, Kurucz' ATLAS9 and PHOENIX/NextGen, for stellar atmosphere synthesis. Our tests relied on the theoretical fit of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a sample of 334 target stars along the whole spectral-type sequence, from the classical optical catalogs of Gunn & Stryker and Jacoby et al. The best-fitting physical parameters (Teff, logg) of stars allowed an independent calibration of the temperature and bolometric scale versus empirical classification parameters (i.e., spectral type and MK luminosity class); in addition, the comparison of the synthetic templates from the ATLAS and NextGen grids allowed us to probe the capability of the models to match spectrophotometric properties of real stars and assess the impact of the different input physics. We can sketch the following main conclusions of our analysis: (1) Fitting accuracy of both theoretical libraries drastically degrades at low Teff at which both ATLAS and NextGen models still fail to properly account for the contribution of molecular features in the observed SED of K-M stars. (2) Compared with empirical calibrations, both ATLAS and NextGen fits tend, on average, to predict slightly warmer (by 4%-8%) Teff for both giant and dwarf stars of fixed spectral type, but ATLAS provides, in general, a sensibly better fit (a factor of 2 lower sigma of flux residuals) than NextGen. (3) There is a striking tendency of NextGen to label target stars with an effective temperature and surface gravity higher than that of ATLAS. The effect is especially evident for MK I-III objects for which about one in four stars is clearly misclassified by NextGen in logg. This is a consequence of some ``degeneracy'' in the solution space, partly induced by the different input physics and geometry constraints in the computation of the integrated emerging flux (ATLAS model atmospheres assume standard plane-parallel layers, while NextGen adopts, for low-gravity stars, a spherical-shell geometry). A different T(tau) vertical structure of stellar atmosphere seems also required for NextGen synthetic SEDs in order to better account for limb-darkening effects in cool stars, as supported by the recent observations of the EROS BLG2000-5 microlensing event.},

	Abstract = {I present the widely used model atmosphere codes ATLAS, MARCS, and PHOENIX, and I compare their output model structures and spectra for cool stars of FGKM-types. While model atmosphere stratifications agree closely with each other in the f-D approximation, this is not the case for spectra. Differences between model spectra from different codes are largest in the blue-UV, but smaller differences appear in all regions, especially in the molecular features of cooler model spectra. I recommend the groups to try to solve these discrepancies together. In the meantime, users must be careful when using these spectra in regimes where they differ.  I discuss here only comparisons of spectra at solar metallicity, and this should be extended to other metallicities. Detailed comparisons with carefully calibrated spectrophotometric data, and high resolution spectra for stars with well known parameters are also of prime importance. It appears that we still need better line positions for molecules. Finally we should remember that f-D models are only a step towards a better representation of reality, and we should keep developing, and carefully test 3-D, NLTE models.},

	Abstract = {We present a new grid of model photospheres for the SDSS-III/APOGEE survey of stellar populations of the Galaxy, calculated using the ATLAS9 and MARCS codes. New opacity distribution functions were generated to calculate ATLAS9 model photospheres. MARCS models were calculated based on opacity sampling techniques. The metallicity ([M/H]) spans from -5 to 1.5 for ATLAS and -2.5 to 0.5 for MARCS models. There are three main differences with respect to previous ATLAS9 model grids: a new corrected H2O line list, a wide range of carbon ([C/M]) and alpha element [alpha/M] variations, and solar reference abundances from Asplund et al. The added range of varying carbon and alpha-element abundances also extends the previously calculated MARCS model grids. Altogether, 1980 chemical compositions were used for the ATLAS9 grid and 175 for the MARCS grid. Over 808,000 ATLAS9 models were computed spanning temperatures from 3500 K to 30,000 K and log g from 0 to 5, where larger temperatures only have high gravities. The MARCS models span from 3500 K to 5500 K, and log g from 0 to 5. All model atmospheres are publicly available online.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Synthetic spectra are needed to determine fundamental stellar and wind parameters of all types of stars. They are also used for the construction of theoretical spectral libraries helpful for stellar population synthesis. Therefore, a database of theoretical spectra is required to allow rapid and quantitative comparisons to spectroscopic data. We provide such a database offering an unprecedented coverage of the entire Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.  Methods: We present the POLLUX database of synthetic stellar spectra. For objects with Teff <= 6000 K, MARCS atmosphere models are computed and the program TURBOSPECTRUM provides the synthetic spectra. ATLAS12 models are computed for stars with 7000 K <= Teff <= 15 000 K. SYNSPEC gives the corresponding spectra. Finally, the code CMFGEN provides atmosphere models for the hottest stars (Teff > 25 000 K). Their spectra are computed with CMF_FLUX. Both high resolution (R > 150 000) optical spectra in the range 3000 to 12 000 {\AA} and spectral energy distributions extending from the UV to near-IR ranges are presented. These spectra cover the HR diagram at solar metallicity.  Results: We propose a wide variety of synthetic spectra for various types of stars in a format that is compliant with the Virtual Observatory standards. A user-friendly web interface allows an easy selection of spectra and data retrieval. Upcoming developments will include an extension to a large range of metallicities and to the near-IR high resolution spectra, as well as a better coverage of the HR diagram, with the inclusion of models for Wolf-Rayet stars and large datasets for cool stars. The POLLUX database is accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pollux.graal.univ-montp2.fr/">http://pollux.graal.univ-montp2.fr/</ext-link> and through the Virtual Observatory.

	Abstract = {We complement the PARSEC database of stellar evolutionary tracks with new models of massive stars, from the pre-main sequence phase to the central carbon ignition. We consider a broad range of metallicities, 0.0001$\leq Z \leq$0.04 and initial masses up to $M_{\rm ini}=350\,M_\odot$. The main difference with respect to our previous models of massive stars is the adoption of a recent formalism accounting for the mass-loss enhancement when the ratio of the stellar to the Eddington luminosity, $\Gamma_e$, approaches unity. With this new formalism, the models are able to reproduce the Humphreys-Davidson limit observed in the Galactic and LMC colour-magnitude diagrams, without an ad hoc mass-loss enhancement. We also follow the predictions of recent wind models indicating that the metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rates becomes shallower when $\Gamma_e$ approaches unity. We thus find that the more massive stars may suffer from substantial mass-loss even at low metallicity. We also predict that the Humphreys-Davidson limit should become brighter at decreasing metallicity. We supplement the evolutionary tracks with new tables of theoretical bolometric corrections, useful to compare tracks and isochrones with the observations. For this purpose, we homogenize existing stellar atmosphere libraries of hot and cool stars (PoWR, ATLAS9 and Phoenix) and we add, where needed, new atmosphere models computed with WM-basic. The mass, age and metallicity grids are fully adequate to perform detailed investigations of the properties of very young stellar systems, both in local and distant galaxies. The new tracks supersede the previous old Padova models of massive stars.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed dynamical analysis of the projected density and kinematical data available for the globular cluster omega Centauri. We solve the spherical anisotropic Jeans equation for a given density profile to predict the projected profiles of the rms velocity {\bar{sigma}}(R), in each of the three orthogonal coordinate directions (line of sight, proper motion radial, and proper motion tangential). The models allow for the presence of a central dark mass, such as a possible intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). We fit the models to new Hubble Space Telescope star count and proper motion data near the cluster center presented in the companion paper, which is Paper I in this series, combined with existing ground-based measurements at larger radii. The projected density profile is consistent with being flat near the center, with an upper limit gamma <~ 0.07 on the central logarithmic slope. The rms proper motion profile is also consistent with being flat near the center. The velocity anisotropy profile, distance, and stellar mass-to-light ratio are all tightly constrained by the data and found to be in good agreement with previous determinations by van de Ven et al. To fit the kinematics, we consider anisotropic models with either a flat core (gamma = 0) or a shallow cusp (gamma = 0.05). Core models provide a good fit to the data with M BH = 0; cusp models require a dark mass. If the dark mass in cusp models is an IMBH, then M BH = (8.7 $\pm$ 2.9) × 103 M sun; if it is a dark cluster, then its extent must be lsim0.16 pc. Isotropic models do not fit the observed proper motion anisotropy and yield spuriously high values for any central dark mass. These models do provide a good fit to the Gauss-Hermite moments of the observed proper motion distributions (h 4 = -0.023 $\pm$ 0.004, h 6 = 0.001 $\pm$ 0.004). There are no unusually fast-moving stars observed in the wings of the proper motion distribution, but we show that this does not strongly constrain the mass of any possible IMBH. The overall end result of the modeling is an upper limit to the mass of any possible IMBH in omega Centauri: M BH <~ 1.2 × 104 M sun at ~1sigma confidence (or lsim1.8 × 104 M sun at ~3sigma confidence). The 1sigma limit corresponds to M BH/M tot <~ 0.43%. We combine this with results for other clusters and discuss the implications for globular cluster IMBH demographics. Tighter limits will be needed to rule out or establish whether globular clusters follow the same black hole demographics correlations as galaxies. The arguments put forward by Noyola et al. to suspect an IMBH in omega Centauri are not confirmed by our study; the value of M BH they suggested is firmly ruled out.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Variations in the stellar initial mass function (IMF) have been invoked to explain the spectroscopic and dynamical properties of early-type galaxies. However, no observations have yet been able to disentangle the physical driver. We analyse here a sample of 24 early-type galaxies drawn from the CALIFA survey, deriving in a homogeneous way their stellar population and kinematic properties. We find that the local IMF is tightly related to the local metallicity, becoming more bottom-heavy towards metal-rich populations. Our result, combined with the galaxy mass-metallicity relation, naturally explains previous claims of a galaxy mass-IMF relation, derived from non-IFU spectra. If we assume that - within the star formation environment of early-type galaxies - metallicity is the main driver of IMF variations, a significant revision of the interpretation of galaxy evolution observables is necessary.},

	Abstract = {Context. Young loose nearby associations are unique samples of close (<150 pc), young (approx 5-100 Myr) pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. A significant number of members of these associations have been identified in the SACY collaboration. We can use the proximity and youth of these members to investigate key ingredients in star formation processes, such as multiplicity. Aims. We present the statistics of identified multiple systems from 113 confirmed SACY members. We derive multiplicity frequencies, mass-ratio, and physical separation distributions in a consistent parameter space, and compare our results to other PMS populations and the field. Methods. We have obtained adaptive-optics assisted near-infrared observations with NACO (ESO/VLT) and IRCAL (Lick Observatory) for at least one epoch of all 113 SACY members. We have identified multiple systems using co-moving proper-motion analysis and using contamination estimates. We have explored ranges in projected separation and mass-ratio of a [3-1000 au], and q [0.1-1], respectively. Results. We have identified 31 multiple systems (28 binaries and 3 triples). We derive a multiplicity frequency (MF) of MF_(3-1000au)=28.4 +4.7, -3.9% and a triple frequency (TF) of TF_(3-1000au)=2.8 +2.5, -0.8% in the separation range of 3-1000 au. We do not find any evidence for an increase in the MF with primary mass. The estimated mass-ratio of our statistical sample (with power-law index gamma=-0.04 +/- 0.14) is consistent with a flat distribution (gamma = 0). Conclusions. We show further similarities (but also hints of discrepancies) between SACY and the Taurus region: flat mass-ratio distributions and statistically similar MF and TF values. We also compared the SACY sample to the field (in the separation range of 19-100 au), finding that the two distributions are indistinguishable, suggesting a similar formation mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Context. The Galactic bulge is a massive, old component of the Milky Way. It is known to host a bar, and it has recently been demonstrated to have a pronounced boxy/peanut structure in its outer region. Several independent studies suggest the presence of more than one stellar populations in the bulge, with different origins and a relative fraction changing across the bulge area.  Aims: This is the first of a series of papers presenting the results of the Giraffe Inner Bulge Survey, carried out at the ESO-VLT with the multifibre spectrograph FLAMES. Spectra of ~5000 red clump giants in 24 bulge fields have been obtained at resolution R = 6500, in the infrared Calcium triplet wavelength region at ~8500 {\AA}. They are used to derive radial velocities and metallicities, based on new calibration specifically devised for this project. Radial velocities for another ~1200 bulge red clump giants, obtained from similar archive data, have been added to the sample. Higher resolution spectra have been obtained for ~450 additional stars at latitude b = -3.5, with the aim of investigating chemical abundance patterns variations with longitude, across the inner bulge. In total we present here radial velocities for 6392 red clump stars.  Methods: We present here the target selection criteria, observing strategy and the catalog with radial velocity measurements for all the target stars.  Results: We derive a radial velocity, and velocity dispersion map of the Milky Way bulge, useful to be compared with similar maps of external bulges, and to infer the expected velocities and dispersion at any line of sight. The K-type giants kinematics is consistent with the cylindrical rotation pattern of M-giants from the BRAVA survey. Our sample enables to extend this result to latitude b = -2, closer to the Galactic plane than probed by previous surveys. Finally, we find strong evidence for a velocity dispersion peak at (0, -1) and (0, -2), possibily indicative of a high density peak in the central ~250 pc of the bulge.

	Abstract = {We extract the resonant orbits from an N-body bar that is a good representation of the Milky Way, using the method recently introduced by Molloy et al. (2015). By decomposing the bar into its constituent orbit families, we show that they are intimately connected to the boxy-peanut shape of the density. We highlight the imprint due solely to resonant orbits on the kinematic landscape towards the Galactic centre. The resonant orbits are shown to have distinct kinematic features and may be used to explain the cold velocity peak seen in the APOGEE commissioning data (Nidever et al. 2012). We show that high velocity peaks are a natural consequence of the motions of stars in the 2:1 orbit family. The locations of the peaks vary with bar angle and, with the tacit assumption that the observed peaks are due to the 2:1 family, we find that the locations of the high velocity peaks correspond to bar angles in the range 10 < theta_bar < 25 (deg). However, some important questions about the nature of the peaks remain, such as their apparent absence in other surveys of the Bulge and the deviations from symmetry between equivalent fields in the north and south.},

	Abstract = {Determining the sequence of events in the formation of stars and planetary systems and their timescales is essential for understanding those processes, yet establishing ages is fundamentally difficult because we lack direct indicators. In this review we discuss the age challenge for young stars, specifically those less than ~100 m.y. old. Most age determination methods that we discuss are primarily applicable to groups of stars but can be used to estimate the age of individual objects. A reliable age scale is established above 20 m.y. from measurement of the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) in young clusters, and consistency is shown between these ages and those from the upper-main-sequence (UMS) and main-sequence (MS) turn-off --- if modest core convection and rotation is included in the models of higher-mass stars. Other available methods for age estimation include the kinematics of young groups, placing stars in Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams (HRDs), pulsations and seismology, surface gravity measurement, rotation and activity, and Li abundance. We review each of these methods and present known strengths and weaknesses. Below ~20 m.y., both model-dependent and observational uncertainties grow, the situation is confused by the possibility of age spreads, and no reliable absolute ages yet exist. The lack of absolute age calibration below 20 m.y. should be born in mind when considering the lifetimes of protostellar phases and circumstellar material.},

	Abstract = {We present a 0.8-5 mum spectral library of 210 cool stars observed at a resolving power of R ≡ lambda/Deltalambda ~ 2000 with the medium-resolution infrared spectrograph, SpeX, at the 3.0 m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The stars have well-established MK spectral classifications and are mostly restricted to near-solar metallicities. The sample not only contains the F, G, K, and M spectral types with luminosity classes between I and V, but also includes some AGB, carbon, and S stars. In contrast to some other spectral libraries, the continuum shape of the spectra is measured and preserved in the data reduction process. The spectra are absolutely flux calibrated using the Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry. Potential uses of the library include studying the physics of cool stars, classifying and studying embedded young clusters and optically obscured regions of the Galaxy, evolutionary population synthesis to study unresolved stellar populations in optically obscured regions of galaxies and synthetic photometry. The library is available in digital form from the IRTF Web site.},

	Abstract = {We present a new analysis of the stellar population of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) based on multi-band optical photometry and spectroscopy. We study the color-color diagrams in BVI, plus a narrowband filter centered at 6200 {\AA}, finding evidence that intrinsic color scales valid for main-sequence dwarfs are incompatible with the ONC in the M spectral-type range, while a better agreement is found employing intrinsic colors derived from synthetic photometry, constraining the surface gravity value as predicted by a pre-main-sequence isochrone. We refine these model colors even further, empirically, by comparison with a selected sample of ONC stars with no accretion and no extinction. We consider the stars with known spectral types from the literature, and extend this sample with the addition of 65 newly classified stars from slit spectroscopy and 182 M-type from narrowband photometry; in this way, we isolate a sample of about 1000 stars with known spectral type. We introduce a new method to self-consistently derive the stellar reddening and the optical excess due to accretion from the location of each star in the BVI color-color diagram. This enables us to accurately determine the extinction of the ONC members, together with an estimate of their accretion luminosities. We adopt a lower distance for the Orion Nebula than previously assumed, based on recent parallax measurements. With a careful choice of also the spectral-type-temperature transformation, we produce the new Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the ONC population, more populated than previous works. With respect to previous works, we find higher luminosity for late-type stars and a slightly lower luminosity for early types. We determine the age distribution of the population, peaking from ~2 to ~3 Myr depending on the model. We study the distribution of the members in the mass-age plane and find that taking into account selection effects due to incompleteness, removes an apparent correlation between mass and age. We derive the initial mass function for low- and intermediate-mass members of the ONC, which turns out to be model dependent and shows a turnover at M <~ 0.2 M sun.},

@article{Hillenbrand:2004sh,
	Abstract = {We have assembled a database of stars having both masses determined from measured orbital dynamics and sufficient spectral and photometric information for their placement on a theoretical H-R diagram. Our sample consists of 115 low-mass (M<2.0 Msolar) stars, 27 pre-main-sequence and 88 main-sequence. We use a variety of available pre-main-sequence evolutionary calculations to test the consistency of predicted stellar masses with dynamically determined masses. Despite substantial improvements in model physics over the past decade, large systematic discrepancies still exist between empirical and theoretically derived masses. For main-sequence stars, all models considered predict masses consistent with dynamical values above 1.2 Msolar and some models predict consistent masses at solar or slightly lower masses, but no models predict consistent masses below 0.5 Msolar, with all models systematically underpredicting such low masses by 5%-20%. The failure at low masses stems from the poor match of most models to the empirical main sequence below temperatures of 3800 K, at which molecules become the dominant source of opacity and convection is the dominant mode of energy transport. For the pre-main-sequence sample we find similar trends. There is generally good agreement between predicted and dynamical masses above 1.2 Msolar for all models. Below 1.2 Msolar and down to 0.3 Msolar (the lowest mass testable), most evolutionary models systematically underpredict the dynamically determined masses by 10%-30%, on average, with the Lyon group models predicting marginally consistent masses in the mean, although with large scatter. Over all mass ranges, the usefulness of dynamical mass constraints for pre-main-sequence stars is in many cases limited by the random errors caused by poorly determined luminosities and especially temperatures of young stars. Adopting a warmer-than-dwarf temperature scale would help reconcile the systematic pre-main-sequence offset at the lowest masses, but the case for this is not compelling, given the similar warm offset at older ages between most sets of tracks and the empirical main sequence. Over all age ranges, the systematic discrepancies between track-predicted and dynamically determined masses appear to be dominated by inaccuracies in the treatment of convection and in the adopted opacities.},

Here model atmosphere structures, spectral energy distributions and synthetic spectra computed with ATLAS9/SYNTHE and TLUSTY/SYNSPEC, and results from a hybrid method combining LTE atmospheres and NLTE line-formation with DETAIL/SURFACE are compared. Their ability to reproduce observations for effective temperatures between 15 000 and 35 000 K are verified. Strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches are identified.

	Abstract = {Context: In analyses of stellar spectra and colours, and for the analysis of integrated light from galaxies, a homogeneous grid of model atmospheres of late-type stars and corresponding flux spectra is needed. Aims: We construct an extensive grid of spherically-symmetric models (supplemented with plane-parallel ones for the highest surface gravities), built on up-to-date atomic and molecular data, and make it available for public use.  Methods: The most recent version of the MARCS program is used.  Results: We present a grid of about 104 model atmospheres for stars with 2500 K <= T_eff <= 8000 K, -1 <= log g = log (GM/R^2) <= 5 (cgs) with various masses and radii, -5 <= [Me/H] <= +1, with [ alpha/Fe] = 0.0 and 0.4 and different choices of C and N abundances. This includes ``CN-cycled'' models with C/N = 4.07 (solar), 1.5 and 0.5, C/O ranging from 0.09 to (normally) 5.0 to also represent stars of spectral types R, S and N, and with 1.0 <= xit <= 5 km s-1. We also list thermodynamic quantities (T, P_g, P_e, rho, partial pressures of molecules, etc.) and provide them on the World Wide Web, as well as calculated fluxes in approximately 108 000 wavelength points. Underlying assumptions in addition to 1D stratification (spherical or plane-parallel) include hydrostatic equilibrium, mixing-length convection and local thermodynamic equilibrium. We discuss a number of general properties of the models, in particular in relation to the effects of changing abundances, of blanketing, and of sphericity. We illustrate positive and negative feedbacks between sphericity and molecular blanketing. We compare the models with those of other available grids and find excellent agreement with plane-parallel models of Castelli & Kurucz (if convection is treated consistently) within the overlapping parameter range. Although there are considerable departures from the spherically-symmetric NextGen models, the agreement with more recent PHOENIX models is gratifying. Conclusions: The models of the grid show considerable regularities, but some interesting departures from general patterns occur for the coolest models due to the molecular opacities. We have tested a number of approximate ``rules of thumb'' concerning effects of blanketing and sphericity and often found them to be astonishingly accurate. Some interesting new phenomena have been discovered and explored, such as the intricate coupling between blanketing and sphericity, and the strong effects of carbon enhancement on metal-poor models. We give further details of line absorption data for molecules, as well as details of models and comparisons with observations in subsequent papers.},

@article{Carson:2015zh,
	Abstract = {We obtained Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 imaging of a sample of ten of the nearest and brightest nuclear clusters (NCs) residing in late-type spiral galaxies, in seven bands that span the near-UV to the near-IR. Structural properties of the clusters were measured by fitting two-dimensional surface brightness profiles to the images using GALFIT. The clusters exhibit a wide range of structural properties, with F814W absolute magnitudes that range from -11.2 to -15.1 mag and F814W effective radii that range from 1.4 to 8.3 pc. For 6 of the 10 clusters in our sample, we find changes in the effective radius with wavelength, suggesting radially varying stellar populations. In four of the objects, the effective radius increases with wavelength, indicating the presence of a younger population that is more concentrated than the bulk of the stars in the cluster. However, we find a general decrease in effective radius with wavelength in two of the objects in our sample, which may indicate extended, circumnuclear star formation. We also find a general trend of increasing roundness of the clusters at longer wavelengths, as well as a correlation between the axis ratios of the NCs and their host galaxies. These observations indicate that blue disks aligned with the host galaxy plane are a common feature of NCs in late-type galaxies, but are difficult to detect in galaxies that are close to face-on. In color--color diagrams spanning the near-UV through the near-IR, most of the clusters lie far from single-burst evolutionary tracks, showing evidence for multi-age populations. Most of the clusters have integrated colors consistent with a mix of an old population (>1 Gyr) and a young population (~100--300 Myr). The wide wavelength coverage of our data provides a sensitivity to populations with a mix of ages that would not be possible to achieve with imaging in optical bands only. The surface brightness profiles presented in this work will be used for future stellar population modeling and dynamical studies of the clusters.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program GO-12163.},

	Abstract = {The model atmosphere programs FASTWIND and CMFGEN are both elegantly designed to perform non-LTE analyses of the spectra of hot massive stars, and include sphericity and mass-loss. The two codes differ primarily in their approach toward line blanketing, with CMFGEN treating all of the lines in the co-moving frame and FASTWIND taking an approximate approach which speeds up execution times considerably. Although both have been extensively used to model the spectra of O-type stars, no studies have used the codes to independently model the same spectra of the same stars and compare the derived physical properties. We perform this task on 10 O-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds. For the late-type O supergiants, both CMFGEN and FASTWIND have trouble fitting some of the He I lines, and we discuss causes and cures. We find that there is no difference in the average effective temperatures found by the two codes for the stars in our sample, although the dispersion is large, due primarily to the various difficulties each code has with He I. The surface gravities determined using FASTWIND are systematically lower by 0.12 dex compared to CMFGEN, a result we attribute to the better treatment of electron scattering by CMFGEN. This has implications for the interpretation of the origin of the so-called mass discrepancy, as the masses derived by FASTWIND are on average lower than inferred from stellar evolutionary models, while those found by CMFGEN are in better agreement.},

@article{Lejeune:1997yo,
	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive hybrid library of synthetic stellar spectra based on three original grids of model atmosphere spectra by [Kurucz (1995)]{ref26}, [Fluks et al. (1994)]{ref19}, and [Bessell et al. (1989, 1991)]{ref6}, respectively. The combined library has been intended for multiple-purpose synthetic photometry applications and was constructed according to the precepts adopted by [Buser & Kurucz (1992)]{ref14}: (i) to cover the largest possible ranges in stellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [M/H]); (ii) to provide flux spectra with useful resolution on the uniform grid of wavelengths adopted by [Kurucz (1995)]{ref26}; and (iii) to provide synthetic broad--band colors which are highly realistic for the largest possible parameter and wavelength ranges. Because the most astrophysically relevant step consists in establishing a realistic library, the corresponding color calibration is described in some detail. Basically, for each value of the effective temperature and for each wavelength, we calculate the correction function that must be applied to a (theoretical) solar-abundance model flux spectrum in order for this to yield synthetic UBVRIJHKL colors matching the (empirical) color-temperature calibrations derived from observations. In this way, the most important systematic differences existing between the original model spectra and the observations can indeed be eliminated. On the other hand, synthetic UBV and Washington ultraviolet excesses delta_{(U-B)} and delta_{(C-M)} and delta_{(C-T1)} obtained from the original giant and dwarf model spectra are in excellent accord with empirical metal-abundance calibrations ([Lejeune & Buser 1996]{ref30}). Therefore, the calibration algorithm is designed in such a way as to preserve the original differential grid properties implied by metallicity and/or luminosity changes in the new library, if the above correction function for a solar-abundance model of a given effective temperature is also applied to models of the same temperature but different chemical compositions [M/H] and/or surface gravities log g. While the new library constitutes a first-order approximation to the program set out above, it will be allowed to develop toward the more ambitious goal of matching the full requirements imposed on a standard library. Major input for refinement and completion is expected from the extensive tests now being made in population and evolutionary synthesis studies of the integrated light of globular clusters ([Lejeune 1997]{ref29}) and galaxies ([Bruzual et al. 1997]{ref10}).},

	Abstract = {A standard library of theoretical stellar spectra intended for multiple synthetic photometry applications including spectral evolutionary synthesis is presented. The grid includes M dwarf model spectra, hence complementing the first library version established in Paper I (\cite[Lejeune et al. 1997]{leje97}). It covers wide ranges of fundamental parameters: {T_eff}: 50 000 K \sim 2000 K, ≶:break 5.5 \sim -1.02, and {[M/H]}: +1.0 \sim -5.0. A correction procedure is also applied to the theoretical spectra in order to provide color-calibrated flux distributions over a large domain of effective temperatures. For this purpose, empirical {T_eff}-color calibrations are constructed between 11500 K and 2000 K, and semi-empirical calibrations for non-solar abundances ({[M/H]} = -3.5 to +1.0) are established. Model colors and bolometric corrections for both the original and the corrected spectra, synthesized in the (UBV)_J(RI)_CJHKLL'M system, are given for the full range of stellar parameters. We find that the corrected spectra provide a more realistic representation of empirical stellar colors, though the method employed is not completely adapted to the lowest temperature models. In particular the original differential colors of the grid implied by metallicity and/or luminosity changes are not preserved below 2500 K. Limitations of the correction method used are also discussed.

@article{Georgy:2013lk,
	Abstract = {Context. B-type stars are known to rotate at various velocities, including very fast rotators near the critical velocity as the Be stars.  Aims: In this paper, we provide stellar models covering the mass range between 1.7 to 15 M&sun;, which includes the typical mass of known Be stars, at Z = 0.014, 0.006, and 0.002 and for an extended range of initial velocities on the zero-age main sequence.  Methods: We used the Geneva stellar-evolution code, including the effects of shellular rotation, with a numerical treatment that has been improved so the code can precisely track the variation in the angular momentum content of the star as it changes under the influence of radiative winds and/or mechanical mass loss.  Results: We discuss the impact of the initial rotation rate on the tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the main-sequence (MS) lifetimes, the evolution of the surface rotation and abundances, as well as on the ejected masses of various isotopes. Among the new results obtained from the present grid we find that 1) fast-rotating stars with initial masses around 1.7 M&sun; present at the beginning of the core hydrogen-burning phase quite small convective cores with respect to their slowly rotating counterparts. This fact may be interesting to keep in mind in the framework of the asteroseismic studies of such stars. 2) The contrast between the core and surface angular velocity is higher in slower rotating stars. Our results are in agreement with the very few values obtained for B-type stars from asteroseismology. 3) At Z = 0.002, the stars in the mass range of 1.7 to 3 M&sun; with a mean velocity on the MS of the order of 150 km s-1 show N/H enhancement superior to 0.2 dex at mid-MS, and superior to 0.4 dex at the end of the MS phase. At solar metallicity the corresponding values are below 0.2 dex at any time in the MS.  Conclusions: An extended database of stellar models containing 270 evolutionary tracks is provided to the community.

	Abstract = {Context. Constraints on stellar models can be obtained from observations of stellar populations, provided the population results from a well defined star formation history.  Aims: We present a new tool for building synthetic colour-magnitude diagrams of coeval stellar populations. We study, from a theoretical point of view, the impact of axial rotation of stars on various observed properties of single-aged stellar populations: magnitude at the turnoff, photometric properties of evolved stars, surface velocities, surface abundances, and the impact of rotation on the age determination of clusters by an isochrone fitting. One application to the cluster NGC 663 is performed.  Methods: Stellar models for different initial masses, metallicities, and zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) rotational velocities are used for building interpolated stellar tracks, isochrones, and synthetic clusters for various ages and metallicities. The synthetic populations account for the effects of the initial distribution of the rotational velocities on the ZAMS, the impact of the inclination angle and the effects of gravity and limb darkening, unresolved binaries, and photometric errors. Interpolated tracks, isochrones, and synthetic clusters can be computed through a public web interface.  Results: For clusters with a metallicity in the range [0.002, 0.014] and an age between 30 Myr and 1 Gyr, the fraction of fast rotators on the main sequence (MS) band is the largest just below the turnoff. This remains true for two different published distributions of the rotational velocities on the ZAMS. This is a natural consequence of the increase in the MS lifetime due to rotation. The fraction of fast rotators one magnitude below the turnoff also increases with the age of the cluster between 30 Myr and 1 Gyr. The most nitrogen-rich stars are found just below the turnoff. There is an increase in the fraction of enriched stars when the metallicity decreases. We show that the use of isochrones computed from rotating stellar models with an initial rotation that is representative of the average initial rotation of the stars in clusters provides a reasonable estimate of the age, even though stars in a real cluster did not start their evolution with an identical initial rotation.},

	Abstract = {We extend the PARSEC library of stellar evolutionary tracks by computing new models of massive stars, from 14 to 350 M&sun;. The input physics is the same used in the PARSEC V1.1 version, but for the mass-loss rate from considering the most recent updates in the literature. We focus on low metallicity, Z = 0.001 and Z = 0.004, for which the metal-poor dwarf irregular star-forming galaxies, Sextans A, the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte galaxy and NGC 6822, provide simple but powerful workbenches. The models reproduce fairly well the observed colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) but the stellar colour distributions indicate that the predicted blue loop is not hot enough in models with a canonical extent of overshooting. In the framework of a mild extended mixing during central hydrogen burning, the only way to reconcile the discrepancy is to enhance the overshooting at the base of the convective envelope (EO) during the first dredge-up. The mixing scales required to reproduce the observed loops, EO = 2HP or EO = 4HP, are definitely larger than those derived from, e.g. the observed location of the red-giant-branch bump in low mass stars. This effect, if confirmed, would imply a strong dependence of the mixing scale below the formal Schwarzschild border, on the stellar mass or luminosity. Reproducing the features of the observed CMDs with standard values of envelope overshooting would require a metallicity significantly lower than the values measured in these galaxies. Other quantities, such as the star formation rate and the initial mass function, are only slightly sensitive to this effect. Future investigations will consider other metallicities and different mixing schemes.},

	Abstract = {We present a probabilistic approach for inferring the parameters of the present-day power-law stellar mass function (MF) of a resolved young star cluster. This technique (1) fully exploits the information content of a given data set; (2) can account for observational uncertainties in a straightforward way; (3) assigns meaningful uncertainties to the inferred parameters; (4) avoids the pitfalls associated with binning data; and (5) can be applied to virtually any resolved young cluster, laying the groundwork for a systematic study of the high-mass stellar MF (M >~ 1 M &sun;). Using simulated clusters and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the probability distribution functions, we show that estimates of the MF slope, alpha, are unbiased and that the uncertainty, Deltaalpha, depends primarily on the number of observed stars and on the range of stellar masses they span, assuming that the uncertainties on individual masses and the completeness are both well characterized. Using idealized mock data, we compute the theoretical precision, i.e., lower limits, on alpha, and provide an analytic approximation for Deltaalpha as a function of the observed number of stars and mass range. Comparison with literature studies shows that ~3/4 of quoted uncertainties are smaller than the theoretical lower limit. By correcting these uncertainties to the theoretical lower limits, we find that the literature studies yield langalpharang = 2.46, with a 1sigma dispersion of 0.35 dex. We verify that it is impossible for a power-law MF to obtain meaningful constraints on the upper mass limit of the initial mass function, beyond the lower bound of the most massive star actually observed. We show that avoiding substantial biases in the MF slope requires (1) including the MF as a prior when deriving individual stellar mass estimates, (2) modeling the uncertainties in the individual stellar masses, and (3) fully characterizing and then explicitly modeling the completeness for stars of a given mass. The precision on MF slope recovery in this paper are lower limits, as we do not explicitly consider all possible sources of uncertainty, including dynamical effects (e.g., mass segregation), unresolved binaries, and non-coeval populations. We briefly discuss how each of these effects can be incorporated into extensions of the present framework. Finally, we emphasize that the technique and lessons learned are applicable to more general problems involving power-law fitting.

@article{Buchner:2014wa,
	Abstract = {Context.  Aims: Active galactic nuclei are known to have complex X-ray spectra that depend on both the properties of the accreting super-massive black hole (e.g. mass, accretion rate) and the distribution of obscuring material in its vicinity (i.e. the "torus"). Often however, simple and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the X-ray spectra of AGN, which do not capture the complexity and diversity of the observations. In the case of blank field surveys in particular, this should have an impact on e.g. the determination of the AGN luminosity function, the inferred accretion history of the Universe and also on our understanding of the relation between AGN and their host galaxies.  Methods: We develop a Bayesian framework for model comparison and parameter estimation of X-ray spectra. We take into account uncertainties associated with both the Poisson nature of X-ray data and the determination of source redshift using photometric methods. We also demonstrate how Bayesian model comparison can be used to select among ten different physically motivated X-ray spectral models the one that provides a better representation of the observations. This methodology is applied to X-ray AGN in the 4 Ms Chandra Deep Field South.  Results: For the ~350 AGN in that field, our analysis identifies four components needed to represent the diversity of the observed X-ray spectra: (1) an intrinsic power law; (2) a cold obscurer which reprocesses the radiation due to photo-electric absorption, Compton scattering and Fe-K fluorescence; (3) an unabsorbed power law associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds; and (4) Compton reflection, most noticeable from a stronger-than-expected Fe-K line. Simpler models, such as a photo-electrically absorbed power law with a Thomson scattering component, are ruled out with decisive evidence (B > 100). We also find that ignoring the Thomson scattering component results in underestimation of the inferred column density, NH, of the obscurer. Regarding the geometry of the obscurer, there is strong evidence against both a completely closed (e.g. sphere), or entirely open (e.g. blob of material along the line of sight), toroidal geometry in favour of an intermediate case.  Conclusions: Despite the use of low-count spectra, our methodology is able to draw strong inferences on the geometry of the torus. Simpler models are ruled out in favour of a geometrically extended structure with significant Compton scattering. We confirm the presence of a soft component, possibly associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds in the opening angle of the torus. The additional Compton reflection required by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a sign of a density gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk. Finally, we release a catalogue of AGN in the CDFS with estimated parameters such as the accretion luminosity in the 2-10 keV band and the column density, NH, of the obscurer.

@article{Sarro:2014xh,
	Abstract = {Context. With the advent of deep wide surveys, large photometric and astrometric catalogues of literally all nearby clusters and associations have been produced. The unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity of these data sets and their broad spatial, temporal and wavelength coverage make obsolete the classical membership selection methods that were based on a handful of colours and luminosities. We present a new technique designed to take full advantage of the high dimensionality (photometric, astrometric, temporal) of such a survey to derive self-consistent and robust membership probabilities of the Pleiades cluster.  Aims: We aim at developing a methodology to infer membership probabilities to the Pleiades cluster from the DANCe multidimensional astro-photometric data set in a consistent way throughout the entire derivation. The determination of the membership probabilities has to be applicable to censored data and must incorporate the measurement uncertainties into the inference procedure.  Methods: We use Bayes' theorem and a curvilinear forward model for the likelihood of the measurements of cluster members in the colour-magnitude space, to infer posterior membership probabilities. The distribution of the cluster members proper motions and the distribution of contaminants in the full multidimensional astro-photometric space is modelled with a mixture-of-Gaussians likelihood.  Results: We analyse several representation spaces composed of the proper motions plus a subset of the available magnitudes and colour indices. We select two prominent representation spaces composed of variables selected using feature relevance determination techniques based in Random Forests, and analyse the resulting samples of high probability candidates. We consistently find lists of high probability (p > 0.9975) candidates with ≈1000 sources, 4 to 5 times more than obtained in the most recent astro-photometric studies of the cluster.  Conclusions: Multidimensional data sets require statistically sound multivariate analysis techniques to fully exploit their scientific information content. Proper motions in particular are, as expected, critical for the correct separation of contaminants. The methodology presented here is ready for application in data sets that include more dimensions, such as radial and/or rotational velocities, spectral indices, and variability.

	Abstract = {We present the Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis package (ASteCA), a suit of tools designed to fully automate the standard tests applied on stellar clusters to determine their basic parameters. The set of functions included in the code make use of positional and photometric data to obtain precise and objective values for a given cluster's center coordinates, radius, luminosity function and integrated color magnitude, as well as characterizing through a statistical estimator its probability of being a true physical cluster rather than a random overdensity of field stars. ASteCA incorporates a Bayesian field star decontamination algorithm capable of assigning membership probabilities using photometric data alone. An isochrone fitting process based on the generation of synthetic clusters from theoretical isochrones and selection of the best fit through a genetic algorithm is also present, which allows ASteCA to provide accurate estimates for a cluster's metallicity, age, extinction and distance values along with its uncertainties. To validate the code we applied it on a large set of over 400 synthetic MASSCLEAN clusters with varying degrees of field star contamination as well as a smaller set of 20 observed Milky Way open clusters (Berkeley 7, Bochum 11, Czernik 26, Czernik 30, Haffner 11, Haffner 19, NGC 133, NGC 2236, NGC 2264, NGC 2324, NGC 2421, NGC 2627, NGC 6231, NGC 6383, NGC 6705, Ruprecht 1, Tombaugh 1, Trumpler 1, Trumpler 5 and Trumpler 14) studied in the literature. The results show that ASteCA is able to recover cluster parameters with an acceptable precision even for those clusters affected by substantial field star contamination. ASteCA is written in Python and is made available as an open source code which can be downloaded ready to be used from its official site.},

	Abstract = {We present new near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the outer edges of the young stellar cluster around the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center. The observations show a break in the surface-density profile of young stars at approximately 13 arcsec (0.52 pc). These observations spectroscopically confirm previous suggestions of a break based on photometry. Using Gemini North's Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer (NIFS) we are able to detect and separate early- and late-type stars with a 75% completeness at Ks = 15.5. We sample a region with radii between 7" to 23" (0.28 pc to 0.92 pc) from Sgr A*, and present new spectral classifications of 144 stars brighter than Ks = 15.5, where 140 stars are late-type (> 1 Gyr) and only four stars are early-type (young, 4-6 Myr). A broken power-law fit of the early-type surface-density matches well with our data and previously published values. The projected surface-density of late-type stars is also measured and found to be consistent with previous results. We find that the observed early-type surface-density profile is inconsistent with the theory of the young stars originating from a tightly bound infalling cluster, as no significant trail of young stars is found at radii above 13". We also note that either a simple disk instability criterion or a cloud-cloud collision could explain the location of the outer edge, though we lack information to make conclusive remarks on either alternative. If this break in surface-density represents an edge to the young stellar cluster it would set an important scale for the most recent episode of star formation at the Galactic center.},

	Abstract = {Massive relic galaxies formed the bulk of their stellar component before z~2 and have remained unaltered since then. Therefore, they represent a unique opportunity to study in great detail the frozen stellar population properties of those galaxies that populated the primitive Universe. We have combined optical to near-infrared line-strength indices in order to infer, out to 1.5 Reff, the IMF of the nearby relic massive galaxy NGC 1277. The IMF of this galaxy is bottom-heavy at all radii, with the fraction of low-mass stars being at least a factor of two larger than that found in the Milky Way. The excess of low-mass stars is present throughout the galaxy, while the velocity dispersion profile shows a strong decrease with radius. This behaviour suggests that local velocity dispersion is not the only driver of the observed IMF variations seen among nearby early-type galaxies. In addition, the excess of low-mass stars shown in NGC 1277 could reflect the effect on the IMF of dramatically different and intense star formation processes at z~2, compared to the less extreme conditions observed in the local Universe.},

@article{Figer:1999px,
	Abstract = {We present near-infrared photometry and K-band spectra of newly identified massive stars in the Quintuplet cluster, one of the three massive clusters projected within 50 pc of the Galactic center. We find that the cluster contains a variety of massive stars, including more unambiguously identified Wolf-Rayet stars than any cluster in the Galaxy, and over a dozen stars in earlier stages of evolution, i.e., luminous blue variables (LBVs), Ofpe/WN9, and OB supergiants. One newly identified star is the second luminous blue variable in the cluster, after the ``Pistol star.'' Although we are unable to provide certain spectral classifications for the five enigmatic Quintuplet-proper members, we tentatively propose that they are extremely dusty versions of the WC stars found elsewhere in the cluster and similar to the dozen or so known examples in the Galaxy. Although the cluster parameters are uncertain because of photometric errors and uncertainties in stellar models, i.e., extrapolating initial masses and estimating ionizing fluxes, we have the following conclusions. Given the evolutionary stages of the identified stars, the cluster appears to be about 4+/-1 Myr old, assuming coeval formation. The total mass in observed stars is ~103 Msolar, and the implied mass is ~104 Msolar, assuming a lower mass cutoff of 1 Msolar and a Salpeter initial mass function. The implied mass density in stars is greater than or similar to a few thousand Msolar pc-3. The newly identified stars increase the estimated ionizing flux from this cluster by about an order of magnitude with respect to earlier estimates, to 1050.9 photons s-1, or roughly what is required to ionize the nearby ``Sickle'' H II region (G0.18-0.04). The total luminosity from the massive cluster stars is ~107.5 Lsolar, enough to account for the heating of the nearby molecular cloud, M0.20-0.033. We propose a picture that integrates most of the major features in this part of the sky, excepting the nonthermal filaments. We compare the cluster to other young massive clusters and globular clusters, finding that it is unique in stellar content and age, except, perhaps, for the young cluster in the central parsec of the Galaxy. In addition, we find that the cluster is comparable to small ``super star clusters.''},

	Abstract = {The spatial morphology and dynamical status of a young, still-forming stellar cluster provide valuable clues to the conditions during the star formation event and the processes that regulated it. We analyze the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), utilizing the latest censuses of its stellar content and membership estimates over a large wavelength range. We determine the center of mass of the ONC and study the radial dependence of angular substructure. The core appears rounder and smoother than the outskirts, which is consistent with a higher degree of dynamical processing. At larger distances, the departure from circular symmetry is mostly driven by the elongation of the system, with very little additional substructure, indicating a somewhat evolved spatial morphology or an expanding halo. We determine the mass density profile of the cluster, which is well fitted by a power law that is slightly steeper than a singular isothermal sphere. Together with the interstellar medium density, which is estimated from average stellar extinction, the mass content of the ONC is insufficient by a factor ~1.8 to reproduce the observed velocity dispersion from virialized motions, in agreement with previous assessments that the ONC is moderately supervirial. This may indicate recent gas dispersal. Based on the latest estimates for the age spread in the system and our density profiles, we find that at the half-mass radius, 90% of the stellar population formed within ~5-8 free-fall times (t ff). This implies a star formation efficiency per t ff of epsilonff ~ 0.04-0.07 (i.e., relatively slow and inefficient star formation rates during star cluster formation).},

	Abstract = {I describe the design, implementation, and usage of galpy, a python package for galactic-dynamics calculations. At its core, galpy consists of a general framework for representing galactic potentials both in python and in C (for accelerated computations); galpy functions, objects, and methods can generally take arbitrary combinations of these as arguments. Numerical orbit integration is supported with a variety of Runge-Kutta-type and symplectic integrators. For planar orbits, integration of the phase-space volume is also possible. galpy supports the calculation of action-angle coordinates and orbital frequencies for a given phase-space point for general spherical potentials, using state-of-the-art numerical approximations for axisymmetric potentials, and making use of a recent general approximation for any static potential. A number of different distribution functions (DFs) are also included in the current release; currently, these consist of two-dimensional axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disk DFs, a three-dimensional disk DF, and a DF framework for tidal streams. I provide several examples to illustrate the use of the code. I present a simple model for the Milky Way's gravitational potential consistent with the latest observations. I also numerically calculate the Oort functions for different tracer populations of stars and compare them to a new analytical approximation. Additionally, I characterize the response of a kinematically warm disk to an elliptical m = 2 perturbation in detail. Overall, galpy consists of about 54,000 lines, including 23,000 lines of code in the module, 11,000 lines of test code, and about 20,000 lines of documentation. The test suite covers 99.6% of the code. galpy is available at http://github.com/jobovy/galpy with extensive documentation available at http://galpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest.},

	Abstract = {We present new diffraction-limited images of the Galactic center, obtained with the W. M. Keck I 10 m telescope. Within 0.4" of the Galaxy's central dark mass, 17 proper-motion stars, with K magnitudes ranging from 14.0 to 16.8, are identified, and 10 of these are new detections (six were also independently discovered by others). In this sample, three newly identified (S0-16, S0-19, and S0-20) and four previously known (S0-1, S0-2, S0-4, and S0-5) sources have measured proper motions that reveal orbital solutions. Orbits are derived simultaneously so that they jointly constrain the central dark object's properties: its mass, its position, and, for the first time using orbits, its motion on the plane of the sky. This analysis pinpoints the Galaxy's central dark mass to within 1.3 mas (10 AU) and limits its proper motion to 1.5+/-0.5 mas yr-1 (or equivalently 60+/-20 km s-1) with respect to the central stellar cluster. This localization of the central dark mass is consistent with our derivation of the position of the radio source Sgr A* in the infrared reference frame (+/-10 mas) but with an uncertainty that is a factor of 8 times smaller, which greatly facilitates searches for near-infrared counterparts to the central black hole. Consequently, one previous claim for such a counterpart can now be ascribed to a close stellar passage in 1996. Furthermore, we can place a conservative upper limit of 15.5 mag on any steady state counterpart emission. The estimated central dark mass from orbital motions is 3.7(+/-0.2)×106[R0/(8kpc)]3Msolar this is a more direct measure of mass than those obtained from velocity dispersion measurements, which are as much as a factor of 2 smaller. The Galactic center's distance, which adds an additional 19% uncertainty in the estimated mass, is now the limiting source of uncertainty in the absolute mass. For stars in this sample, the closest approach is achieved by S0-16, which came within a mere 45 AU (=0.0002pc=600Rs) at a velocity of 12,000 km s-1. This increases the inferred dark mass density by 4 orders of magnitude compared to earlier analyses based on velocity and acceleration vectors, making the Milky Way the strongest existing case for a supermassive black hole at the center of a normal-type galaxy. Well-determined orbital parameters for these seven Sgr A* cluster stars also provide new constraints on how these apparently massive, young (<10 Myr) stars formed in a region that seems to be hostile to star formation. Unlike the more distant He I emission line stars-another population of young stars in the Galactic center-that appear to have coplanar orbits, the Sgr A* cluster stars have orbital properties (eccentricities, angular momentum vectors, and apoapse directions) that are consistent with an isotropic distribution. Therefore, many of the mechanisms proposed for the formation of the He I stars, such as formation from a preexisting disk, are unlikely solutions for the Sgr A* cluster stars. Unfortunately, alternative theories for producing young stars, or old stars that look young, in close proximity to a central supermassive black hole are all also somewhat problematic. Understanding the apparent youth of stars in the Sgr A* cluster, as well as the more distant He I emission line stars, has now become one of the major outstanding issues in the study of the Galactic center.},

	Abstract = {We develop and present effective PSFs for the F606W filter in the WFC, and then for five other filters. After briefly reviewing the concept of the effective PSF, we show that the WFC PSF varies with position in the detector. We represent the PSF by a 9×10 array of fiducial PSFs, between which a tailor-made PSF is to be interpolated for each star. Fitting these PSFs to star images gives photometry and astrometry with accuracies of 0.01 mag and 0.01 pixel, respectively, for well-exposed star images. We study short-term variability of the PSF and also study it over the history of ACS. The variability with time depends mainly on focus, and can be represented as a spatially fixed ``perturbation PSF'' for each image. We make FORTRAN programs available for generating our PSFs, for measuring star images with them, and for a number of related utility tasks.},

Using an optimal contrast, matched-filter technique, we find a long, almost linear stellar stream with an average width of 1.4d.

	Abstract = {Near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the infrared cluster in the central parsec of the galaxy have been obtained. Very-high resolution images of IRS 16 allow an upper limit of 10 percent to be placed to the contribution to the energetics in this region by Sgr A-asterisk. However, the very blue colors of at least five components of IRS 16 suggest that they together could power the region. A deep image at 1.25 micron detects at least three of the sources bright at 10 micron, demonstrating that these objects contain self-luminous cores. Constraints on the temperatures of these cores are placed with infrared spectroscopy, and they appear to be too hot and bright in the near-infrared to be single stars. These cores may also contribute significantly to the overall luminosity of the central parsec.},

	Abstract = {I review the basic properties of interstellar extinction in the Milky Way galaxy, focusing primarily on the wavelength dependence within the IR through UV spectral region.  My primary goal is to review the evidence supporting the idea that Galactic extinction curves can be considered a 1-parameter family characterized by their value of RV ≡ AV/E(B-V).  Based on analysis of new (i.e., 2MASS) and old (i.e., IUE) data for ˜100 sightlines, I show that the UV, optical, and IR wavelength regimes do display coherent variations, but with too much intrinsic scatter to be considered truly correlated. A 1-parameter family can be constructed which illustrates these broad trends, but very few individual sightlines are actually well-reproduced by such a family and disagreement with the mean trends is not a sufficient condition for ``peculiarity.'' Only a very small number of extinction sightlines stand out as truly peculiar.  It is likely that simple variations in the mean grain size from sightline to sightline are responsible for much of the coherent variability seen in Galactic extinction, and might also explain the ``peculiar'' extinction long-noted in the Magellanic Clouds.},

@article{Mishenina:2006ij,
	Abstract = {Aims.The aim of this paper is to provide the fundamental parameters and abundances for a large sample of local clump giants with a high accuracy. This study is a part of a big project, in which the vertical distribution of the stars in the Galactic disc and the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy are being investigated. Methods: .The selection of clump stars for the sample group was made applying a colour-absolute magnitude window to nearby Hipparcos stars. The effective temperatures were estimated by the line depth ratio method. The surface gravities (log {g}) were determined by two methods (the first one was the method based on the ionization balance of iron and the second one was the method based on fitting of the wings of the Ca I 6162.17 {\AA} line). The abundances of carbon and nitrogen were obtained from the molecular synthetic spectrum, and the Mg and Na abundances were derived using the non-LTE approximation. The "classical" models of stellar evolution without atomic diffusion and rotation-induced mixing were employed.  Results: .The atmospheric parameters ({T_eff}, log {g}, [Fe/H], {Vt}) and Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ni abundances in 177 clump giants of the Galactic disc were determined. The underabundance of carbon, overabundance of nitrogen, and "normal" abundance of oxygen were detected. A small sodium overabundance was found. A possibility of a selection of the clump giants based on their chemical composition and the evolutionary tracks was explored.  Conclusions: .The theoretical predictions based on the classical stellar evolution models are in good agreement with the observed surface variations of the carbon and nitrogen just after the first dredge-up episode. The giants show the same behaviour of the dependencies of O, Mg, Ca, and Si (alpha-elements) and Ni (iron-peak element) abundances vs. [Fe/H] as dwarfs do. This allows us to use such abundance ratios to study the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy.},

@article{Portegies-Zwart:2002hc,
	Abstract = {We study the evolution and observability of young, compact star clusters near the Galactic center, such as the Arches and Quintuplet systems. The clusters are modeled by integrating the equations of motion of all stars while accounting for the internal evolution of stars and binaries, as well as the effect of the Galactic tidal field. We find that clusters within 150 pc of the Galactic center dissolve within ~55 Myr, but their projected densities drop below the background density in the direction of the Galactic center within only a few megayears, effectively making these clusters undetectable after that time. Detailed observations of the Arches cluster, taken at face value, suggest that its mass function is unusually flat and that the cluster contains an overabundance of stars more massive than 20 Msolar. Our dynamical analysis, however, shows that the observed characteristics of the Arches cluster are consistent with a perfectly normal initial mass function. The observed anomalies are then caused by a combination of observational selection effects and the dynamical evolution of the cluster. We calibrate the current parameters of the Arches cluster using a normal initial mass function and conclude that the cluster is more massive than 40,000 Msolar, has a half-mass radius of about 0.35 pc, and is located between 50 and 90 pc from the Galactic center.},

	Abstract = {We present the reddening [E(V-I)] and extinction maps in the V band (AV) and the I band (AI) for 48 Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment II (OGLE-II) Galactic bulge (GB) fields, covering a range of -11$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 11$\,^{\circ}$, with the total area close to 11 deg2. These measurements are based on two-band photometry of red clump giant (RCG) stars in OGLE-II VI maps of the GB. We confirm the anomalous value of the ratio of total to selective extinction RVI≡AV/E(V-I) = 1.9-2.1, depending on the line of sight, as measured recently by Udalski. By using the average value of RVI= 1.964 with the standard deviation sdev= 0.085, we measured E(V-I), AV and AI, and we obtained extinction and reddening maps with a high spatial resolution of 26.7-106.8 arcsec, depending on the stellar density of each field. We have assumed that average, reddening corrected colours of RCGs are the same in every field. The maps cover the ranges 0.42 < E(V-I) < 3.5, 0.83 < AV < 6.9 and 0.41 < AI < 3.4 mag, respectively. The zero-points of these maps are calibrated by using V-K colours of 20 RR Lyrae ab variables (RRab) in Baade's window. The apparent reddening corrected I-band magnitudes of the RCGs change by +0.4 mag while the Galactic coordinate l varies from +5$\,^{\circ}$ to -5$\,^{\circ}$, indicating that these stars are in the Galactic bar. The reddening corrected colour of RRab and RCGs in the GB are consistent with colours of local stars, while in the past these colours were claimed to be different.},

	Abstract = {The Milky Way induces a strong tidal perturbation on its satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We present numerical simulations of tidal interactions between these low-density dwarf spheroidal galaxies and the Milky Way. Our results indicate that dwarf spheroidal galaxies with limiting radius much larger than the theoretical tidal radius are unstable and likely to be tidally disrupted on a Hubble-time. However, dwarf spheroidal galaxies can survive over a Hubble time if their limiting radii are less than twice their tidal radii at perigalacticon. In a galaxy which is undergoing tidal disruption, (1) the projected surface density is flattened in the galaxy's orbital plane and follows a power-law distribution from the galaxy's center, (2) the velocity dispersion is sustained at the current virial equilibrium value, and (3) the central density ofthe residual remnant is maintained even after most of the initial mass is lost. Beyond the tidal radius, the escapers have a radial velocity gradient along the azimuthal direction of the galaxy's motion. When compared with observational data, our theoretical results are consistent with the scenarios that (1) some dwarf spheroidal galaxies contain dark matter, and (2) some dwarf spheroidal galaxies may be part of the debris that was tidally torn from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by the Galaxy.},

@article{Odenkirchen:2003jk,
	Abstract = {Using wide-field photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we recently showed that the Galactic globular cluster Palomar 5 is in the process of being tidally disrupted. Its tidal tails were initially detected in a 2.5d wide band along the celestial equator. A new analysis of SDSS data for a larger field now reveals that the tails of Pal 5 have a much larger spatial extent and can be traced over an arc of 10$\,^{\circ}$ on the sky, corresponding to a projected length of 4 kpc at the distance of the cluster. The tail that trails behind the Galactic motion of the cluster fades into the field at an angular distance of 6.5d from the cluster center but shows a pronounced density maximum between 2$\,^{\circ}$ and 4$\,^{\circ}$ from the center. The leading tail, of length 3.5d, extends down to the border of the available field and thus presumably continues beyond it. The projected width of these tails is small and almost constant (FWHM~120 pc), which implies that they form a dynamically cold and hence long-lived structure. The number of former cluster stars found in the tails adds up to about 1.2 times the number of stars in the cluster, that is, the tails are more massive than the cluster in its present state. The radial profile of stellar surface density in the tails approximately follows a power law rgamma with -1.5<=gamma<=-1.2. The stream of debris from Pal 5 is significantly curved, which demonstrates its acceleration by the Galactic potential. The stream sets tight constraints on the geometry of the cluster's Galactic orbit. We conclude that the cluster is presently near the apocenter but has repeatedly undergone disk crossings in the inner part of the Galaxy leading to strong tidal shocks. Using the spatial offset between the tails and the cluster's orbit, we estimate the mean drift rate of the tidal debris and thus the mean mass-loss rate of the cluster. Our results suggest that the observed debris originates mostly from mass loss within the last 2 Gyr. The cluster is likely to be destroyed after the next disk crossing, which will happen in about 100 Myr. There is strong evidence against the suggestion that Pal 5 might be associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We report the detection of a pair of degree-long tidal tails associated with the globular cluster Palomar 14, using images obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We reveal a power-law departure from a King profile at large distances to the cluster center. The density map constructed with the optimal matched filter technique shows a nearly symmetrical and elongated distribution of stars on both sides of the cluster, forming an S-shape characteristic of mass loss. This evidence may be the telltale signature of tidal stripping in action. This, together with its large Galactocentric distance, imposes strong constraints on its orbit and/or origin: (1) it must follow an external orbit confined to the peripheral region of the Galactic halo and/or (2) it formed in a satellite galaxy later accreted by the Milky Way.},

@article{Chieffi:2013hw,
	Abstract = {We present the first set of a new generation of models of massive stars with a solar composition extending between 13 and 120 M &sun;, computed with and without the effects of rotation. We included two instabilities induced by rotation: the meridional circulation and the shear instability. We implemented two alternative schemes to treat the transport of the angular momentum: the advection-diffusion formalism and the simpler purely diffusive one. The full evolution from the pre-main sequence up to the pre-supernova stage is followed in detail with a very extended nuclear network. The explosive yields are provided for a variety of possible mass cuts and are available at the Web site http://www.iasf-roma.inaf.it/orfeo/public_html. We find that both the He and the CO core masses are larger than those of their non-rotating counterparts. Also the C abundance left by the He burning is lower than in the non-rotating case, especially for stars with an initial mass of 13-25 M &sun;, and this affects the final mass-radius relation, basically the final binding energy, at the pre-supernova stage. The elemental yields produced by a generation of stars rotating initially at 300 km s-1 do not change substantially with respect to those produced by a generation of non-rotating massive stars, the main differences being a slight overproduction of the weak s-component and a larger production of F. Since rotation also affects the mass-loss rate, either directly or indirectly, we find substantial differences in the lifetimes as O-type and Wolf-Rayet subtypes between the rotating and non-rotating models. The maximum mass exploding as Type IIP supernova ranges between 15 and 20 M &sun; in both sets of models (this value depends basically on the larger mass-loss rates in the red supergiant phase due to the inclusion of the dust-driven wind). This limiting value is in remarkably good agreement with current estimates.},

	Abstract = {We extend our theoretical computations for low-mass stars to intermediate-mass and massive stars, for which few databases exist in the literature. Evolutionary tracks and isochrones are computed for initial masses 2.50-20~M&sun; for a grid of 37 chemical compositions with metal content Z between 0.0001 and 0.070 and helium content Y between 0.23 and 0.40 to enable users to obtain isochrones for ages as young as about 107 years and to simulate stellar populations with different helium-to-metal enrichment laws. The Padova stellar evolution code is identical to that used in the first paper of this series. Synthetic TP-AGB models allow stellar tracks and isochrones to be extended until the end of the thermal pulses along the AGB. We provide software tools for the bidimensional interpolation (in Y and Z) of the isochrones from very old ages down to about 107 years. This lower limit depends on chemical composition. The extension of the blue loops and the instability strip of Cepheid stars are compared and the Cepheid mass-discrepancy is discussed. The location of red supergiants in the H-R diagram is in good agreement with the evolutionary tracks for masses from 10 to 20~M&sun;. Tracks and isochrones are available in tabular form for the adopted grid of chemical compositions in the extended plane Z-Y in three photometric systems. An interactive web interface allows users to obtain isochrones of any chemical composition inside the provided Z-Y range and also to simulate stellar populations with different Y(Z) helium-to-metal enrichment laws.

	Abstract = {We present a dense grid of evolutionary tracks and isochrones of rotating massive main-sequence stars. We provide three grids with different initial compositions tailored to compare with early OB stars in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds and in the Galaxy. Each grid covers masses ranging from 5 to 60 M&sun; and initial rotation rates between 0 and about 600 km s-1. To calibrate our models we used the results of the VLT-FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars. We determine the amount of convective overshooting by using the observed drop in rotation rates for stars with surface gravities log g < 3.2 to determine the width of the main sequence. We calibrate the efficiency of rotationally induced mixing using the nitrogen abundance determinations for B stars in the Large Magellanic cloud. We describe and provide evolutionary tracks and the evolution of the central and surface abundances. In particular, we discuss the occurrence of quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution, i.e. the severe effects of efficient mixing of the stellar interior found for the most massive fast rotators. We provide a detailed set of isochrones for rotating stars. Rotation as an initial parameter leads to a degeneracy between the age and the mass of massive main sequence stars if determined from its observed location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We show that the consideration of surface abundances can resolve this degeneracy.

	Abstract = {We present the updated version of the code used to compute stellar evolutionary tracks in Padova. It is the result of a thorough revision of the major input physics, together with the inclusion of the pre-main sequence phase, not present in our previous releases of stellar models. Another innovative aspect is the possibility of promptly generating accurate opacity tables fully consistent with any selected initial chemical composition, by coupling the Opacity Project At Livermore (OPAL) data at high temperatures to the molecular opacities computed with our {\ae}SOPUS code. In this work, we present extended sets of stellar evolutionary models for various initial chemical compositions, while other sets with different metallicities and/or different distributions of heavy elements are being computed. For the present release of models, we adopt the solar distribution of heavy elements from the recent revision by Caffau et al., corresponding to a Sun's metallicity Z ~= 0.0152. From all computed sets of stellar tracks, we also derive isochrones in several photometric systems. The aim is to provide the community with the basic tools to model star clusters and galaxies by means of population synthesis techniques.},

@article{Pietrinferni:2004mf,
	Abstract = {We present a large and updated stellar evolution database for low-, intermediate-, and high-mass stars in a wide metallicity range, suitable for studying Galactic and extragalactic simple and composite stellar populations using population synthesis techniques. The stellar mass range is between ~0.5 and 10 Msolar with a fine mass spacing. The metallicity [Fe/H] comprises 10 values ranging from -2.27 to 0.40, with a scaled solar metal distribution. The initial He mass fraction ranges from Y=0.245, for the more metal-poor composition, up to 0.303 for the more metal-rich one, with DeltaY/DeltaZ~1.4. For each adopted chemical composition, the evolutionary models have been computed without (canonical models) and with overshooting from the Schwarzschild boundary of the convective cores during the central H-burning phase. Semiconvection is included in the treatment of core convection during the He-burning phase. The whole set of evolutionary models can be used to compute isochrones in a wide age range, from ~30 Myr to ~15 Gyr. Both evolutionary models and isochrones are available in several observational planes, employing an updated set of bolometric corrections and color-Teff relations computed for this project. The number of points along the models and the resulting isochrones is selected in such a way that interpolation for intermediate metallicities not contained in the grid is straightforward; a simple quadratic interpolation produces results of sufficient accuracy for population synthesis applications.We compare our isochrones with results from a series of widely used stellar evolution databases and perform some empirical tests for the reliability of our models. Since this work is devoted to scaled solar chemical compositions, we focus our attention on the Galactic disk stellar populations, employing multicolor photometry of unevolved field main-sequence stars with precise Hipparcos parallaxes, well-studied open clusters, and one eclipsing binary system with precise measurements of masses, radii, and [Fe/H] of both components. We find that the predicted metallicity dependence of the location of the lower, unevolved main sequence in the color magnitude diagram (CMD) appears in satisfactory agreement with empirical data. When comparing our models with CMDs of selected, well-studied, open clusters, once again we were able to properly match the whole observed evolutionary sequences by assuming cluster distance and reddening estimates in satisfactory agreement with empirical evaluations of these quantities. In general, models including overshooting during the H-burning phase provide a better match to the observations, at least for ages below ~4 Gyr. At [Fe/H] around solar and higher ages (i.e., smaller convective cores) before the onset of radiative cores, the selected efficiency of core overshooting may be too high in our model, as well as in various other models in the literature. Since we also provide canonical models, the reader is strongly encouraged to always compare the results from both sets in this critical age range.},

@article{Landin:2010nu,
	Abstract = {Context. Magnetic fields are at the heart of the observed stellar activity in late-type stars, and they are presumably generated by a dynamo mechanism at the interface layer (tachocline) between the radiative core and the base of the convective envelope.  Aims: Since dynamo models are based on the interaction between differential rotation and convective motions, the introduction of rotation in the ATON 2.3 stellar evolutionary code allows for explorations regarding a physically consistent treatment of magnetic effects in stellar structure and evolution, even though there are formidable mathematical and numerical challenges involved.  Methods: As examples of such explorations, we present theoretical estimates for both the local convective turnover time (tau_c), and global convective times (tau_g) for rotating pre-main sequence solar-type stars, based on up-to-date input physics for stellar models. Our theoretical predictions are compared with the previous ones available in the literature. In addition, we investigate the dependence of the convective turnover time on convection regimes, the presence of rotation and atmospheric treatment.  Results: Those estimates, as opposed to the use of empirically derived values of tau_c for such matters, can be used to calculate the Rossby number Ro, which is related to the magnetic activity strength in dynamo theories and, at least for main-sequence stars, shows an observational correlation with stellar activity. More important, they can also contribute for testing stellar models against observations.  Conclusions: Our theoretical values of tau_c, tau_g and Ro qualitatively agree with those published by Kim & Demarque (1996, ApJ, 457, 340). By increasing the convection efficiency, tau_g decreases for a given mass. FST models show still lower values. The presence of rotation shifts tau_g towards slightly higher values when compared with non-rotating models. The use of non-gray boundary conditions in the models yields values of tau_g smaller than in the gray approximation.

	Abstract = {The ever-expanding depth and quality of photometric and spectroscopic observations of stellar populations increase the need for theoretical models in regions of age-composition parameter space that are largely unexplored at present. Stellar evolution models that employ the most advanced physics and cover a wide range of compositions are needed to extract the most information from current observations of both resolved and unresolved stellar populations. The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is a collection of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones that spans a range of [Fe/H] from -2.5 to +0.5, [alpha/Fe] from -0.2 to +0.8 (for [Fe/H]<=0) or +0.2 (for [Fe/H]>0), and initial He mass fractions from Y=0.245 to 0.40. Stellar evolution tracks were computed for masses between 0.1 and 4 Msolar, allowing isochrones to be generated for ages as young as 250 Myr. For the range in masses where the core He flash occurs, separate He-burning tracks were computed starting from the zero age horizontal branch. The tracks and isochrones have been transformed to the observational plane in a variety of photometric systems including standard UBV(RI)C, Stromgren uvby, SDSS ugriz, 2MASS JHKs, and HST ACS/WFC and WFPC2. The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is accessible through a Web site at http://stellar.dartmouth.edu/~models/ where all tracks, isochrones, and additional files can be downloaded.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Many topical astrophysical research areas, such as the properties of planet host stars, the nature of the progenitors of different types of supernovae and gamma ray bursts, and the evolution of galaxies, require complete and homogeneous sets of stellar models at different metallicities in order to be studied during the whole of cosmic history. We present here a first set of models for solar metallicity, where the effects of rotation are accounted for in a homogeneous way.  Methods: We computed a grid of 48 different stellar evolutionary tracks, both rotating and non-rotating, at Z = 0.014, spanning a wide mass range from 0.8 to 120 M&sun;. For each of the stellar masses considered, electronic tables provide data for 400 stages along the evolutionary track and at each stage, a set of 43 physical data are given. These grids thus provide an extensive and detailed data basis for comparisons with the observations. The rotating models start on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) with a rotation rate upsiloini/upsilocrit = 0.4. The evolution is computed until the end of the central carbon-burning phase, the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, or the core helium-flash for, respectively, the massive, intermediate, and both low and very low mass stars. The initial abundances are those deduced by Asplund and collaborators, which best fit the observed abundances of massive stars in the solar neighbourhood. We update both the opacities and nuclear reaction rates, and introduce new prescriptions for the mass-loss rates as stars approach the Eddington and/or the critical velocity. We account for both atomic diffusion and magnetic braking in our low-mass star models.  Results: The present rotating models provide a good description of the average evolution of non-interacting stars. In particular, they reproduce the observed main-sequence width, the positions of the red giant and supergiant stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, the observed surface compositions and rotational velocities. Very interestingly, the enhancement of the mass loss during the red-supergiant stage, when the luminosity becomes supra-Eddington in some outer layers, help models above 15-20 M&sun; to lose a significant part of their hydrogen envelope and evolve back into the blue part of the HR diagram. This result has interesting consequences for the blue to red supergiant ratio, the minimum mass for stars to become Wolf-Rayet stars, and the maximum initial mass of stars that explode as type II-P supernovae.

	Abstract = {We present new Fokker-Planck models of the evolution of globular clusters, including gravitational tidal shocks. We extend our calculations beyond the core collapse by adopting three-body binary heating. Effects of the shocks are included by adding the tidal shock diffusion coefficients to the ordinary Fokker-Planck equation: the first-order heating term, <DeltaE>, and the second-order energy dispersion term, <DeltaE2>. As an example, we investigate the evolution of models for the globular cluster NGC 6254. Using the Hipparcos proper motions, we are now able to construct orbits of this cluster in the Galaxy. Tidal shocks accelerate significantly both core collapse and the evaporation of the cluster and shorten the destruction time from 24 to 18 Gyr. We examine various types of adiabatic corrections and find that they are critical for accurate calculation of the evolution. Without adiabatic corrections, the destruction time of the cluster is twice as short. We examine cluster evolution for a wide range of the concentration and tidal shock parameters and determine the region of the parameter space where tidal shocks dominate the evolution. We present fitting formulae for the core collapse time and the destruction time, covering all reasonable initial conditions. In the limit of strong shocks, the typical value of the core collapse time decreases from 10trh to 3trh or less, while the destruction time is just twice that number. The effects of tidal shocks are rapidly self-limiting: as clusters lose mass and become more compact, the importance of the shocks diminishes. This implies that tidal shocks were more important in the past.},

	Abstract = {We constrain the properties of massive binaries by comparing radial velocity data on early-type stars in Cygnus OB2 with the expectations of Monte Carlo models. Our comparisons test several popular prescriptions for massive binary parameters. We explore a range of true binary fraction, F, a range of power-law slopes, alpha, describing the distribution of companion masses between the limits qlow and 1, and a range of power-law slopes, beta, describing the distribution of orbital separations between the limits rin and rout. We also consider distributions of secondary masses described by a Miller-Scalo type IMF and by a two-component IMF that includes a substantial ``twin'' population with M2~=M1. Several seemingly disparate prescriptions for massive binary characteristics can be reconciled by adopting carefully chosen values for F, rin, and rout. We show that binary fractions F<0.7 are less probable than F>=0.8 for reasonable choices of rin and rout. Thus, the true binary fraction is high. For F=1.0 and a distribution of orbital separations near the canonical ``Opik's law distribution (i.e., flat; beta=0), the power-law slope of the mass ratio distribution is alpha=-0.6 to 0.0. For F~=0.8, alpha is somewhat larger, in the range -0.4 to 1.0. In any case, the secondary star mass function is inconsistent with a Miller-Scalo-like IMF unless the lower end is truncated below ~2-4 Msolar. In other words, massive stars preferentially have massive companions. The best-fitting models are described by a Salpeter or Miller-Scalo IMF for 60% of secondary star masses with the other ~40% of secondaries having M2~=M1, i.e., ``twins.'' These model parameters simultaneously predict the fraction of Type Ib/c supernovae to be 30%-40% of all core-collapse supernovae, in agreement with recent observational estimates.},

@article{Maiz-Apellaniz:2009mj,
	Abstract = {It is currently common to use spatially unresolved multifilter broadband photometry to determine the masses of individual stellar clusters (and hence the cluster mass function, CMF). I analyze the stochastic effects introduced by the sampling of the stellar initial mass function (SIMF) in the derivation of the individual masses and the CMF, and I establish that such effects are the largest contributor to the observational uncertainties. An analytical solution, valid in the limit where uncertainties are small, is provided to establish the range of cluster masses over which the CMF slope can be obtained with a given accuracy. The validity of the analytical solution is extended to higher mass uncertainties using Monte Carlo simulations and the Gamma approximation. The value of the Poisson mass is calculated for a large range of ages and a variety of filters for solar-metallicity clusters measured with single-filter photometry. A method that uses the code CHORIZOS is presented to simultaneously derive masses, ages, and extinctions. The classical method of using unweighted UBV photometry to simultaneously establish ages and extinctions of stellar clusters is found to be unreliable for clusters older than ≈30 Ma, even for relatively large cluster masses. On the other hand, augmenting the filter set to include longer-wavelength filters and using weights for each filter increases the range of masses and ages that can be accurately measured with unresolved photometry. Nevertheless, a relatively large range of masses and ages is found to be dominated by SIMF sampling effects that render the observed masses useless, even when using UBVRIJHK photometry. A revision of some literature results affected by these effects is presented and possible solutions for future observations and analyses are suggested.},

@article{Maiz-Apellaniz:2008yk,
	Abstract = {When calculating stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) for young clusters, one has to take into account that (1) most massive stars are born in multiple systems, (2) most IMFs are derived from data that cannot resolve such systems, and (3) multiple chance superpositions between members are expected to happen if the cluster is too distant. In this article I use numerical experiments to model the consequences of those phenomena on the observed color-magnitude diagrams and the IMFs derived from them. Real multiple systems affect the observed or apparent massive-star MF slope little but can create a significant population of apparently ultramassive stars. Chance superpositions produce only small biases when the number of superimposed stars is low but, once a certain number threshold is reached, they can affect both the observed slope and the apparent stellar upper mass limit. I apply these experiments to two well known massive young clusters in the Local Group, NGC 3603 and R136. In both cases I show that the observed population of stars with masses above 120 Msolar can be explained by the effects of unresolved objects, mostly real multiple systems for NGC 3603 and a combination of real and chance-alignment multiple systems for R136. Therefore, the case for the reality of a stellar upper mass limit at solar or near-solar metallicities is strengthened, with a possible value even lower than 150 Msolar. An IMF slope somewhat flatter than Salpeter or Kroupa with gamma between -1.6 and -2.0 is derived for the central region of NGC 3603, with a significant contribution to the uncertainty arising from the imprecise knowledge of the distance to the cluster. The IMF at the very center of R136 cannot be measured with the currently available data but the situation could change with new HST observations.  This article is partially based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST), some of them associated with GO program 10602 and the rest gathered from the archive, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We detect and quantify significant numerical biases in the determination of the slope of power laws with Salpeter (or similar) indices from uniformly binned data using chi2 minimization. The biases are caused by the correlation between the number of stars per bin and the assigned weights and are especially important when the number of stars per bin is small. This result implies the existence of systematic errors in the values of IMFs calculated in this way. We propose as an alternative using variable-size bins and dividing the stars evenly among them. Such variable-size bins yield very small biases that are only weakly dependent on the number of stars per bin. Furthermore, we show that they allow for the calculation of reliable IMFs with only a small total number of stars. Therefore, they are a preferred alternative to the standard uniform-size binning.},

The sample of ~4500 new radial velocities, mostly in the region -10$\,^{\circ}$ < l < +10$\,^{\circ}$ and b ≈ -6$\,^{\circ}$, more than doubles the existent published data set. Our new data extend our rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile to +20$\,^{\circ}$, which is ~2.8 kpc from the Galactic center. The new data confirm the cylindrical rotation observed at -6$\,^{\circ}$ and -8$\,^{\circ}$ and are an excellent fit to the Shen et al. N-body bar model. We measure the strength of the TiOε molecular band as a first step toward a metallicity ranking of the stellar sample, from which we confirm the presence of a vertical abundance gradient. Our survey finds no strong evidence of previously unknown kinematic streams. We also publish our complete catalog of radial velocities, photometry, TiO band strengths, and spectra, which is available at the Infrared Science Archive as well as at UCLA.},

	Abstract = {We present new results from BRAVA, a large-scale radial velocity survey of the Galactic bulge, using M giant stars selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog as targets for the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 4 m Hydra multi-object spectrograph. The purpose of this survey is to construct a new generation of self-consistent bar models that conform to these observations. We report the dynamics for fields at the edge of the Galactic bulge at latitudes b = -8$\,^{\circ}$ and compare to the dynamics at b = -4$\,^{\circ}$. We find that the rotation curve V(r) is the same at b = -8$\,^{\circ}$ as at b = -4$\,^{\circ}$. That is, the Galactic boxy bulge rotates cylindrically, as do boxy bulges of other galaxies. The summed line-of-sight velocity distribution at b = -8$\,^{\circ}$ is Gaussian, and the binned longitude-velocity plot shows no evidence for either a (disk) population with cold dynamics or for a (classical bulge) population with hot dynamics. The observed kinematics are well modeled by an edge-on N-body bar, in agreement with published structural evidence. Our kinematic observations indicate that the Galactic bulge is a prototypical product of secular evolution in galaxy disks, in contrast with stellar population results that are most easily understood if major mergers were the dominant formation process.},

	Abstract = {We present stellar proper motions in the Galactic bulge from the Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Search (SWEEPS) project using ACS WFC on HST. Proper motions are extracted for more than 180,000 objects, with >81,000 measured to accuracy better than 0.3 mas yr-1 in both coordinates. We report several results based on these measurements: (1) Kinematic separation of bulge from disk allows a sample of >15,000 bulge objects to be extracted based on >=6 sigma detections of proper motion, with <0.2% contamination from the disk. This includes the first detection of a candidate bulge blue straggler population. (2) Armed with a photometric distance modulus on a star-by-star basis, and using the large number of stars with high-quality proper-motion measurements to overcome intrinsic scatter, we dissect the kinematic properties of the bulge as a function of distance along the line of sight. This allows us to extract the stellar circular speed curve from proper motions alone, which we compare with the circular speed curve obtained from radial velocities. (3) We trace the variation of the {l,b} velocity ellipse as a function of depth. (4) Finally, we use the density-weighted {l,b} proper-motion ellipse produced from the tracer stars to assess the kinematic membership of the 16 transiting planet candidates discovered in the Sagittarius Window; the kinematic distribution of the planet candidates is consistent with that of the disk and bulge stellar populations.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-2655.},

@article{Puls:2005xi,
	Abstract = {We present new or improved methods for calculating NLTE, line-blanketed model atmospheres for hot stars with winds (spectral types A to O), with particular emphasis on fast performance. These methods have been implemented into a previous, more simple version of the model atmosphere code Fastwind (Santolaya-Rey et al. 1997) and allow us to spectroscopically analyze large samples of massive stars in a reasonable time-scale, using state-of-the-art physics. Although this updated version of the code has already been used in a number of recent investigations, the corresponding methods have not been explained in detail so far, and no rigorous comparison with results from alternative codes has been performed. This paper intends to address both topics. In particular, we describe our (partly approximate) approach to solve the equations of statistical equilibrium for those elements that are primarily responsible for line-blocking and blanketing, as well as an approximate treatment of the line-blocking itself, which is based on a simple statistical approach using suitable means of line opacities and emissivities. Both methods are validated by specific tests. Furthermore, we comment on our implementation of a consistent temperature structure. In the second part, we concentrate on a detailed comparison with results from two codes used in alternative spectroscopical investigations, namely cmfgen (Hillier & Miller 1998) and wm-Basic (Pauldrach et al. 2001). All three codes predict almost identical temperature structures and fluxes for lambda > 400 {\AA}, whereas at lower wavelengths a number of discrepancies are found. Particularly in the Heii continua, where fluxes and corresponding numbers of ionizing photons react extremely sensitively to subtle differences in the models, we consider any uncritical use of these quantities (e.g., in the context of nebula diagnostics) as unreliable. Optical H/He lines as synthesized by fastwind are compared with results from cmfgen, obtaining a remarkable coincidence, except for the Hei singlets in the temperature range between 36 000 to 41 000 K for dwarfs and between 31 000 to 35 000 K for supergiants, where cmfgen predicts much weaker lines. Consequences of these discrepancies are discussed. Finally, suggestions are presented as to adequately parameterize model-grids for hot stars with winds, with only one additional parameter compared to standard grids from plane-parallel, hydrostatic models.},

	Abstract = {We present evolutionary models for young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs taking into account episodic phases of accretion at early stages of the evolution, a scenario supported by recent large surveys of embedded protostars. An evolution including short episodes of vigorous accretion (\dot{M}>= 10^{-4} M_&sun; yr^{-1}) followed by longer quiescent phases (\dot{M}< 10^{-6} M_&sun; yr^{-1}) can explain the observed luminosity spread in H-R diagrams of star-forming regions at ages of a few Myr, for objects ranging from a few Jupiter masses to a few tenths of a solar mass. The gravitational contraction of these accreting objects strongly departs from the standard Hayashi track at constant T eff. The best agreement with the observed luminosity scatter is obtained if most of the accretion shock energy is radiated away. The obtained luminosity spread at 1 Myr in the H-R diagram is equivalent to what can be misinterpreted as an ~10 Myr age spread for non-accreting objects. We also predict a significant spread in radius at a given T eff, as suggested by recent observations. These calculations bear important consequences for our understanding of star formation and early stages of evolution and on the determination of the initial mass function for young (<= a few Myr) clusters. Our results also show that the concept of a stellar birthline for low-mass objects has no valid support.},

@article{Chabrier:2003wb,
	Abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m>~1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc~0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass sigma~0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc~0.2 Msolar and sigma~0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD~n*~0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages >~130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc~0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ~1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.  The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

	Abstract = {This contribution describes the difficult task of inferring the IMF from local star-count data, by discussing the mass-luminosity relation, unresolved binary, triple and quadruple systems, abundance and age spreads and Galactic structure, all of which must be accounted for properly for the results to be meaningful. A consensus emerges that the local IMF may be represented by a two-part power-law, with indices alpha=1-1.5 for stars with mass m<0.5 Msun, and the Salpeter value alpha=2.3 for more massive stars, but some uncertainties remain. Notable is also that the sensitivity of the stellar luminosity function (LF) to the derivative of the mass-luminosity relation is very evident in the (local) Hipparcos and HST, open-cluster and globular-cluster LFs, thus allowing tests of stellar structure theory. The upcoming astrometry space missions DIVA and GAIA will undoubtedly lead to significant advances in this field.},

Initially, there were no known examples having masses >104, yet we now know that there are at least a half dozen such clusters in the Galaxy. In all but one case, the masses have been determined through infrared observations. Several had been identified as clusters long ago, but their massive natures were only recently determined. Presumably, we are just scratching the surface, and we might look forward to having statistically significant samples of coeval massive stars at all important stages of stellar evolution in the near future.

	Abstract = {We have obtained long-slit optical spectra of 10 Wolf-Rayet galaxies and four other starburst galaxies. Using the nebular emission lines we have determined the electron temperatures, electron densities, extinctions, oxygen abundances, mass of ionized hydrogen, and numbers of ionizing photons due to hot stars in these galaxies. The various forbidden line ratios clearly indicate a stellar origin for the emission-line spectrum. From the flux of the broad He II 4686 A emission feature we have estimated the number of Wolf-Rayet stars present. We have accounted for the contribution of these stars to the total ionizing flux and have calculated the ratio of the number of these stars to the number of O stars. Wolf-Rayet galaxies are among the youngest examples of the starburst phenomenon, which we observed at a propitious moment.},

	Abstract = {We report the definite spectroscopic identification of ~=40 OB supergiants, giants, and main-sequence stars in the central parsec of the Galaxy. Detection of their absorption lines has become possible with the high spatial and spectral resolution and sensitivity of the adaptive optics integral field spectrometer SPIFFI/SINFONI on the ESO VLT. Several of these OB stars appear to be helium- and nitrogen-rich. Almost all of the ~=80 massive stars now known in the central parsec (central arcsecond excluded) reside in one of two somewhat thick (<h/R>~=0.14) rotating disks. These stellar disks have fairly sharp inner edges (R~=1'') and surface density profiles that scale as R-2. We do not detect any OB stars outside the central 0.5 pc. The majority of the stars in the clockwise system appear to be on almost circular orbits, whereas most of those in the ``counterclockwise'' disk appear to be on eccentric orbits. Based on its stellar surface density distribution and dynamics, we propose that IRS 13E is an extremely dense cluster (rhocore>~3×108 Msolar pc-3) that has formed in the counterclockwise disk. The stellar contents of both systems are remarkably similar, indicating a common age of ~=6+/-2 Myr. The K-band luminosity function of the massive stars suggests a top-heavy mass function and limits the total stellar mass contained in both disks to ~=1.5×104 Msolar. Our data strongly favor in situ star formation from dense gas accretion disks for the two stellar disks. This conclusion is very clear for the clockwise disk and highly plausible for the counterclockwise system.  Based on observations with the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile.},

	Abstract = {Accurate determinations of stellar mass functions and ages of stellar populations are crucial to much of astrophysics. We analyse the evolution of stellar mass functions of coeval main sequence stars including all relevant aspects of single- and binary-star evolution. We show that the slope of the upper part of the mass function in a stellar cluster can be quite different to the slope of the initial mass function. Wind mass loss from massive stars leads to an accumulation of stars which is visible as a peak at the high mass end of mass functions, thereby flattening the mass function slope. Mass accretion and mergers in close binary systems create a tail of rejuvenated binary products. These blue straggler stars extend the single star mass function by up to a factor of two in mass and can appear up to ten times younger than their parent stellar cluster. Cluster ages derived from their most massive stars that are close to the turn-off may thus be significantly biased. To overcome such difficulties, we propose the use of the binary tail of stellar mass functions as an unambiguous clock to derive the cluster age because the location of the onset of the binary tail identifies the cluster turn-off mass. It is indicated by a pronounced jump in the mass function of old stellar populations and by the wind mass loss peak in young stellar populations. We further characterise the binary induced blue straggler population in star clusters in terms of their frequency, binary fraction and apparent age.},

	Abstract = {We have recently carried out the first wide-field hydrogen Paschen-alpha line imaging survey of the Galactic Centre using the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instrument aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The survey maps out a region of ) around the central supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) in the 1.87 and 1.90mum narrow bands with a spatial resolution of ~0.01pc (0.2arcsec full width at half-maximum) at a distance of 8kpc. Here, we present an overview of the observations, data reduction, preliminary results and potential scientific implications, as well as a description of the rationale and design of the survey. We have produced mosaic maps of the Paschen-alpha line and continuum emission, giving an unprecedentedly high-resolution and high-sensitivity panoramic view of stars and photoionized gas in the nuclear environment of the Galaxy. We detect a significant number of previously undetected stars with Paschen-alpha in emission. They are most likely massive stars with strong winds, as confirmed by our initial follow-up spectroscopic observations. About half of the newly detected massive stars are found outside the known clusters (Arches, Quintuplet and Central). Many previously known diffuse thermal features are now resolved into arrays of intriguingly fine linear filaments indicating a profound role of magnetic fields in sculpting the gas. The bright spiral-like Paschen-alpha emission around Sgr A* is seen to be well confined within the known dusty torus. In the directions roughly perpendicular to it, we further detect faint, diffuse Paschen-alpha emission features, which, like earlier radio images, suggest an outflow from the structure. In addition, we detect various compact Paschen-alpha nebulae, probably tracing the accretion and/or ejection of stars at various evolutionary stages. Multiwavelength comparisons together with follow-up observations are helping us to address such questions as where and how massive stars form, how stellar clusters are disrupted, how massive stars shape and heat the surrounding medium, how various phases of this medium are interspersed and how the supermassive black hole interacts with its environment.},

	Abstract = {Powerful telescopes equipped with multi-fibre or integral field spectrographs combined with detailed models of stellar atmospheres and automated fitting techniques allow for the analysis of large number of stars. These datasets contain a wealth of information that require new analysis techniques to bridge the gap between observations and stellar evolution models. To that end, we develop Bonnsai (BONN Stellar Astrophysics Interface), a Bayesian statistical method, that is capable of comparing all available observables simultaneously to stellar models while taking observed uncertainties and prior knowledge such as initial mass functions and distributions of stellar rotational velocities into account. Bonnsai can be used to (1) determine probability distributions of fundamental stellar parameters such as initial masses and stellar ages from complex datasets; (2) predict stellar parameters that were not yet observationally determined; and (3) test stellar models to further advance our understanding of stellar evolution. An important aspect of Bonnsai is that it singles out stars that cannot be reproduced by stellar models through chi2 hypothesis tests and posterior predictive checks. Bonnsai can be used with any set of stellar models and currently supports massive main-sequence single star models of Milky Way and Large and Small Magellanic Cloud composition. We apply our new method to mock stars to demonstrate its functionality and capabilities. In a first application, we use Bonnsai to test the stellar models of Brott et al. (2011, A&A, 530, A115) by comparing the stellar ages inferred for the primary and secondary stars of eclipsing Milky Way binaries of which the components range in mass between 4.5 and 28 M&sun;. Ages are determined from dynamical masses and radii that are known to better than 3%. We show that the stellar models must include rotation because stellar radii can be increased by several percent via centrifugal forces. We find that the average age difference between the primary and secondary stars of the binaries is 0.9 $\pm$ 2.3 Myr (95% CI), i.e. that the stellar models reproduce the Milky Way binaries well. The predicted effective temperatures are in agreement for observed effective temperatures for stars cooler than 25 000 K. In hotter stars, i.e. stars earlier than B1-2V and more massive than about 10 M&sun;, we find that the observed effective temperatures are on average hotter by 1.1 $\pm$ 0.3 kK (95% CI) and the bolometric luminosities are consequently larger by 0.06 $\pm$ 0.02 dex (95% CI) than predicted by the stellar models.  Bonnsai is available through a web-interface at http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/stars/bonnsai},

	Abstract = {Context. The evolution of massive stars is not fully understood. The relation between different types of evolved massive stars is not clear, and the role of factors such as binarity, rotation or magnetism needs to be quantified.  Aims: Several groups make available the results of 1D single stellar evolution calculations in the form of evolutionary tracks and isochrones. They use different stellar evolution codes for which the input physics and its implementation varies. In this paper, we aim at comparing the currently available evolutionary tracks for massive stars. We focus on calculations aiming at reproducing the evolution of Galactic stars. Our main goal is to highlight the uncertainties on the predicted evolutionary paths.  Methods: We compute stellar evolution models with the codes MESA and STAREVOL. We compare our results with those of four published grids of massive stellar evolution models (Geneva, STERN, Padova and FRANEC codes). We first investigate the effects of overshooting, mass loss, metallicity, chemical composition. We subsequently focus on rotation. Finally, we compare the predictions of published evolutionary models with the observed properties of a large sample of Galactic stars.  Results: We find that all models agree well for the main sequence evolution. Large differences in luminosity and temperatures appear for the post main sequence evolution, especially in the cool part of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. Depending on the physical ingredients, tracks of different initial masses can overlap, rendering any mass estimate doubtful. For masses between 7 and 20 M&sun;, we find that the main sequence width is slightly too narrow in the Geneva models including rotation. It is (much) too wide for the (STERN) FRANEC models. This conclusion is reached from the investigation of the HR diagram and from the evolution of the surface velocity as a function of surface gravity. An overshooting parameter alpha between 0.1 and 0.2 in models with rotation is preferred to reproduce the main sequence width. Determinations of surface abundances of carbon and nitrogen are partly inconsistent and cannot be used at present to discriminate between the predictions of published tracks. For stars with initial masses larger than about 60 M&sun;, the FRANEC models with rotation can reproduce the observations of luminous O supergiants and WNh stars, while the Geneva models remain too hot.  STAREVOL and MESA tracks are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/560/A16},

	Abstract = {We present a new census of the Orion Nebula Cluster over a large field of view (gsim 30' × 30'), significantly increasing the known population of stellar and substellar cluster members with precisely determined properties. We develop and exploit a technique to determine stellar effective temperatures from optical colors, nearly doubling the previously available number of objects with effective temperature determinations in this benchmark cluster. Our technique utilizes colors from deep photometry in the I band and in two medium-band filters at lambda ~ 753 and 770 nm, which accurately measure the depth of a molecular feature present in the spectra of cool stars. From these colors we can derive effective temperatures with a precision corresponding to better than one-half spectral subtype, and importantly this precision is independent of the extinction to the individual stars. Also, because this technique utilizes only photometry redward of 750 nm, the results are only mildly sensitive to optical veiling produced by accretion. Completing our census with previously available data, we place some 1750 sources in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and assign masses and ages down to 0.02 solar masses. At faint luminosities, we detect a large population of background sources which is easily separated in our photometry from the bona fide cluster members. The resulting initial mass function of the cluster has good completeness well into the substellar mass range, and we find that it declines steeply with decreasing mass. This suggests a deficiency of newly formed brown dwarfs in the cluster compared to the Galactic disk population.},

	Abstract = {We examine the performance of standard pre-main-sequence (PMS) stellar evolution models against the accurately measured properties of a benchmark sample of 26 PMS stars in 13 eclipsing binary (EB) systems having masses 0.04-4.0 M&sun; and nominal ages ≈1-20 Myr. We provide a definitive compilation of all fundamental properties for the EBs, with a careful and consistent reassessment of observational uncertainties. We also provide a definitive compilation of the various PMS model sets, including physical ingredients and limits of applicability. No set of model isochrones is able to successfully reproduce all of the measured properties of all of the EBs. In the H-R diagram, the masses inferred for the individual stars by the models are accurate to better than 10% at ≳1 M&sun;, but below 1 M&sun; they are discrepant by 50-100%. Adjusting the observed radii and temperatures using empirical relations for the effects of magnetic activity helps to resolve the discrepancies in a few cases, but fails as a general solution. We find evidence that the failure of the models to match the data is linked to the triples in the EB sample; at least half of the EBs possess tertiary companions. Excluding the triples, the models reproduce the stellar masses to better than ~10% in the H-R diagram, down to 0.5 M&sun;, below which the current sample is fully contaminated by tertiaries. We consider several mechanisms by which a tertiary might cause changes in the EB properties and thus corrupt the agreement with stellar model predictions. We show that the energies of the tertiary orbits are comparable to that needed to potentially explain the scatter in the EB properties through injection of heat, perhaps involving tidal interaction. It seems from the evidence at hand that this mechanism, however it operates in detail, has more influence on the surface properties of the stars than on their internal structure, as the lithium abundances are broadly in good agreement with model predictions. The EBs that are members of young clusters appear individually coeval to within 20%, but collectively show an apparent age spread of ~50%, suggesting true age spreads in young clusters. However, this apparent spread in the EB ages may also be the result of scatter in the EB properties induced by tertiaries.},

	Abstract = {The frequency and properties of multiple star systems offer powerful tests of star formation models. Multiplicity surveys over the past decade have shown that binary properties vary strongly with mass, but the functional forms and the interplay between frequency and semimajor axis remain largely unconstrained. We present the results of a large-scale survey of multiplicity at the bottom of the initial mass function in several nearby young associations, encompassing 78 very low mass members observed with Keck laser guide star adaptive optics. Our survey confirms the overall trend observed in the field for lower-mass binary systems to be less frequent and more compact, including a null detection for any substellar binary systems with separations wider than ~7 AU. Combined with a Bayesian re-analysis of existing surveys, our results demonstrate that the binary frequency and binary separations decline smoothly between masses of 0.5 M &sun; and 0.02 M &sun;, though we cannot distinguish the functional form of this decline due to a degeneracy between the total binary frequency and the mean binary separation. We also show that the mass ratio distribution becomes progressively more concentrated at q ~ 1 for declining masses, though a small number of systems appear to have unusually wide separations and low-mass ratios for their mass. Finally, we compare our results to synthetic binary populations generated by smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations, noting the similarities and discussing possible explanations for the differences.},

The combined sample shows that the core radii increase from about 0 to about 5 pc between about 1 Myr and 1 Gyr, and then begin to decrease again. The expansion of the cores is probably driven by mass loss from evolving stars. Models of cluster evolution show that the rate of increase in core radius is sensitive to the slope of the initial mass function. The observed core radius-age relation for the LMC clusters favors an intial mass function with slope slightly flatter than the Salpeter value.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this work is to explore the escape process of three-dimensional orbits in a star cluster rotating around its parent galaxy in a circular orbit. The gravitational field of the cluster is represented by a smooth, spherically symmetric Plummer potential, while the tidal approximation was used to model the steady tidal field of the galaxy. We conduct a thorough numerical analysis distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits as well as between trapped and escaping orbits, considering only unbounded motion for several energy levels. It is of particular interest to locate the escape basins towards the two exit channels and relate them with the corresponding escape times of the orbits. For this purpose, we split our investigation into three cases depending on the initial value of the z-coordinate which was used for launching the stars. The most noticeable finding is that the majority of stars initiated very close to the primary (x, y) plane move in chaotic orbits and they remain trapped for vast time intervals, while orbits with relatively high values of z0 on the other hand, form well-defined basins of escape. It was also observed, that for energy levels close to the critical escape energy the escape rates of orbits are large, while for much higher values of energy most of the orbits have low escape periods or they escape immediately to infinity. We hope our outcomes to be useful for a further understanding of the dissolution process and the escape mechanism in open star clusters.},

	Abstract = {We report results of collisional N-body simulations aimed at studying the N dependence of the dynamical evolution of star clusters. Our clusters consist of equal-mass stars and are in virial equilibrium. Clusters moving in external tidal fields and clusters limited by a cut-off radius are simulated. Our main focus is to study the dependence of the lifetimes of the clusters on the number of cluster stars and the chosen escape condition. We find that star clusters in external tidal fields exhibit a scaling problem in the sense that their lifetimes do not scale with the relaxation time. Isolated clusters show a similar problem if stars are removed only after their distance to the cluster centre exceeds a certain cut-off radius. If stars are removed immediately after their energy exceeds the energy necessary for escape, the scaling problem disappears. We show that some stars that gain the energy necessary for escape are scattered to lower energies before they can leave the cluster. As the efficiency of this process decreases with increasing particle number, it causes the lifetimes not to scale with the relaxation time. Analytic formulae are derived for the scaling of the lifetimes in the different cases.},

	Abstract = {Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters. Many of them invoke multiple generations of stars to explain the observed chemical abundance anomalies, but it has also been suggested that self-enrichment could occur via accretion of ejecta from massive stars onto the circumstellar disc of low-mass pre-main sequence stars. These scenarios imply different initial conditions for the kinematics of the various stellar populations. Given some net angular momentum initially, models for which a second generation forms from gas that collects in a cooling flow into the core of the cluster predict an initially larger rotational amplitude for the polluted stars compared to the pristine stars. This is opposite to what is expected from the accretion model, where the polluted stars are the ones crossing the core and are on preferentially radial (low-angular momentum) orbits, such that their rotational amplitude is lower. Here we present the results of a suite of $N$-body simulations with initial conditions chosen to capture the distinct kinematic properties of these pollution scenarios. We show that initial differences in the kinematics of polluted and pristine stars can survive to the present epoch in the outer parts of a large fraction of Galactic globular clusters. The differential rotation of pristine and polluted stars is identified as a unique kinematic signature that could allow us to distinguish between various scenarios, while other kinematic imprints are generally very similar from one scenario to the other.},

@article{Vesperini:2013kx,
	Abstract = {Numerous spectroscopic and photometric observational studies have provided strong evidence for the widespread presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters. In this paper, we study the long-term dynamical evolution of multiple population clusters, focusing on the evolution of the spatial distributions of the first- (FG) and second-generation (SG) stars. In previous studies, we have suggested that SG stars formed from the ejecta of FG AGB stars are expected initially to be concentrated in the cluster inner regions. Here, by means of N-body simulations, we explore the time-scales and the dynamics of the spatial mixing of the FG and the SG populations and their dependence on the SG initial concentration.  Our simulations show that, as the evolution proceeds, the radial profile of the SG/FG number ratio, NSG/NFG, is characterized by three regions: (1) a flat inner part; (2) a declining part in which FG stars are increasingly dominant and (3) an outer region where the NSG/NFG profile flattens again (the NSG/NFG profile may rise slightly again in the outermost cluster regions). Until mixing is complete and the NSG/NFG profile is flat over the entire cluster, the radial variation of NSG/NFG implies that the fraction of SG stars determined by observations covering a limited range of radial distances is not, in general, equal to the SG global fraction, (NSG/NFG)glob. The distance at which NSG/NFG equals (NSG/NFG)glob is approximately between 1 and 2 cluster half-mass radii. The time-scale for complete mixing depends on the SG initial concentration, but in all cases complete mixing is expected only for clusters in advanced evolutionary phases, having lost at least 60-70 per cent of their mass due to two-body relaxation (in addition to the early FG loss due to the cluster expansion triggered by SNII ejecta and gas expulsion).The results of our simulations suggest that in many Galactic globular clusters the SG should still be more spatially concentrated than the FG.},

	Abstract = {We examine the radial distributions of stellar populations in the globular cluster (GC) M15, using HST/WFC3 photometry of red giants in the nitrogen-sensitive F343N-F555W color. Surprisingly, we find that giants with "primordial" composition (i.e., N abundances similar to those in field stars) are the most centrally concentrated within the WFC3 field. We then combine our WFC3 data with SDSS u, g photometry and find that the trend reverses for radii >1' (3 pc) where the ratio of primordial to N-enhanced giants increases outwards, as already found by Lardo et al. The ratio of primordial to enriched stars thus has a U-shaped dependency on radius with a minimum near the half-light radius. N-body simulations show that mass segregation might produce a trend resembling the observed one, but only if the N-enhanced giants are ~0.25 Mo less massive than the primordial giants, which requires extreme He enhancement (Y~0.40). However, such a large difference in Y is incompatible with the negligible optical color differences between primordial and enriched giants which suggest Delta Y < 0.03 and thus a difference in turn-off mass of Delta M < 0.04 Mo between the different populations. The radial trends in M15 are thus unlikely to be of dynamical origin and presumably reflect initial conditions, a result that challenges all current GC formation scenarios. We note that population gradients in the central regions of GCs remain poorly investigated and may show a more diverse behavior than hitherto thought.},

	Abstract = {Context. It is generally accepted today that Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) consist of at least two generations of stars that are different in their chemical composition and perhaps age. However, knowledge about the kinematical properties of these stellar generations, which may provide important information for constraining evolutionary scenarios of the GGCs, is still limited.  Aims: We study the connections between chemical and kinematical properties of different stellar generations in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc.  Methods: To achieve this goal, we used abundances of Li, O, and Na determined in 101 main sequence turn-off (TO) stars with the aid of 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres and NLTE abundance analysis methodology. We divided our sample TO stars into three groups according to their position in the [Li/Na] - [Na/O] plane to study their spatial distribution and kinematical properties.  Results: We find that there are statistically significant radial dependencies of lithium and oxygen abundances, A(Li) and A(O), as well as that of [Li/Na] abundance ratio. Our results show that first-generation stars are less centrally concentrated and dynamically hotter than stars belonging to subsequent generations. We also find a significant correlation between the velocity dispersion and O and Na abundance, and between the velocity dispersion and the [Na/O] abundance ratio.},

@article{Bastian:2013lr,
	Abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs), once thought to be well approximated as simple stellar populations (i.e. all stars having the same age and chemical abundance), are now known to host a variety of anomalies, such as multiple discrete (or spreads in) populations in colour-magnitude diagrams and abundance variations in light elements (e.g. Na, O, Al). Multiple models have been put forward to explain the observed anomalies, although all have serious shortcomings (e.g. requiring a non-standard initial mass function of stars and GCs to have been initially 10-100 times more massive than observed today). These models also do not agree with observations of massive stellar clusters forming today, which do not display significant age spreads nor have gas/dust within the cluster. Here we present a model for the formation of GCs, where low-mass pre-main-sequence stars accrete enriched material released from interacting massive binary and rapidly rotating stars on to their circumstellar discs, and ultimately on to the young stars. As was shown in previous studies, the accreted material matches the unusual abundances and patterns observed in GCs. The proposed model does not require multiple generations of star formation, conforms to the known properties of massive clusters forming today and solves the `mass budget problem' without requiring GCs to have been significantly more massive at birth. Potential caveats to the model as well as model predictions are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present the first study of high-precision internal proper motions (PMs) in a large sample of globular clusters, based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data obtained over the past decade with the ACS/WFC, ACS/HRC, and WFC3/UVIS instruments. We determine PMs for over 1.3 million stars in the central regions of 22 clusters, with a median number of ~60,000 stars per cluster. These PMs have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the internal kinematics of globular clusters by extending past line-of-sight (LOS) velocity measurements to two- or three-dimensional velocities, lower stellar masses, and larger sample sizes. We describe the reduction pipeline that we developed to derive homogeneous PMs from the very heterogeneous archival data. We demonstrate the quality of the measurements through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We also discuss the PM errors introduced by various systematic effects and the techniques that we have developed to correct or remove them to the extent possible. We provide in electronic form the catalog for NGC 7078 (M 15), which consists of 77,837 stars in the central 2.'4. We validate the catalog by comparison with existing PM measurements and LOS velocities and use it to study the dependence of the velocity dispersion on radius, stellar magnitude (or mass) along the main sequence, and direction in the plane of the sky (radial or tangential). Subsequent papers in this series will explore a range of applications in globular-cluster science and will also present the PM catalogs for the other sample clusters.

	Abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution in stellar masses produced from a burst of star formation. For more than 50 yr, the implicit assumption underpinning most areas of research involving the IMF has been that it is universal, regardless of time and environment. We measure the high-mass IMF slope for a sample of low-to-moderate redshift galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey. The large range in luminosities and galaxy masses of the sample permits the exploration of underlying IMF dependencies. A strong IMF-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows that highly star-forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they have IMFs with flatter power-law slopes) than galaxies with low star formation rates. This has a significant impact on a wide variety of galaxy evolution studies, all of which rely on assumptions about the slope of the IMF. Our result is supported by, and provides an explanation for, the results of numerous recent explorations suggesting a variation of or evolution in the IMF.},

The data are drawn from the 11 Mpc Halpha and Ultraviolet Galaxy Survey (11HUGS), which has obtained Halpha fluxes from ground-based narrowband imaging, and UV fluxes from imaging with GALEX. For normal spiral galaxies (SFR ~ 1 M sun yr-1), our results are consistent with previous work which has shown that FUV SFRs tend to be lower than Halpha SFRs before accounting for internal dust attenuation, but that there is relative consistency between the two tracers after proper corrections are applied. However, a puzzle is encountered at the faint end of the luminosity function. As lower luminosity dwarf galaxies, roughly less active than the Small Magellanic Cloud, are examined, Halpha tends to increasingly underpredict the total SFR relative to the FUV. The trend is evident prior to corrections for dust attenuation, which affects the FUV more than the nebular Halpha emission, so this general conclusion is robust to the effects of dust. Although past studies have suggested similar trends, this is the first time this effect is probed with a statistical sample for galaxies with SFR <~ 0.1 M sun yr-1. By SFR ~ 0.003 M sun yr-1, the average Halpha-to-FUV flux ratio is lower than expected by a factor of two, and at the lowest SFRs probed, the ratio exhibits an order of magnitude discrepancy for the handful of galaxies that remain in the sample. A range of standard explanations does not appear to be able to fully account for the magnitude of the systematic. Some recent work has argued for a stellar initial mass function which is deficient in high-mass stars in dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, and we also consider this scenario. Under the assumption that the FUV traces the SFR in dwarf galaxies more robustly, the prescription relating Halpha luminosity to SFR is re-calibrated for use in the low SFR regime when FUV data are not available.},

	Abstract = {This paper revisits the classical Kennicutt method for inferring the stellar IMF from the integrated light properties of galaxies. The large-size, uniform high-quality data set from the SDSS DR4 is combined with more in-depth modeling and quantitative statistical analysis to search for systematic IMF variations as a function of galaxy luminosity. Galaxy Halpha equivalent widths are compared to a broadband color index to constrain the IMF. This parameter space is useful for breaking degeneracies that are traditionally problematic. Age and dust corrections are largely orthogonal to IMF variations. In addition, the effects of metallicity and smooth SFH e-folding times are small compared to IMF variations. We find that for the sample as a whole the best-fitting IMF slope above 0.5 Msolar is Gamma=1.4535, with a negligible random error of +/-0.0004 and a systematic error of +/-0.1. Galaxies brighter than around Mr,0.1=-20 (including galaxies like the Milky Way, which has Mr,0.1~-21) are well fitted by a universal Gamma~1.4 IMF, similar to Salpeter, and smooth, exponential SFHs. Fainter galaxies prefer steeper IMFs, and the quality of the fits reveals that for these galaxies a universal IMF with smooth SFHs is actually a poor assumption. Several sources of sample bias are ruled out as the cause of these luminosity-dependent IMF variations. Analysis of bursting SFH models shows that an implausible coordination of burst times is required to fit a universal IMF to the Mr,0.1=-17 galaxies. This leads to the conclusions that the IMF in low-luminosity galaxies has fewer massive stars, by either steeper slope or lower upper mass cutoff, and is not universal.},

@article{Meurer:2009pi,
	Abstract = {Many of the results in modern astrophysics rest on the notion that the initial mass function (IMF) is universal. Our observations of a sample of H I selected galaxies in the light of Halpha and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) challenge this result. The extinction-corrected flux ratio F Halpha/f FUV from these two tracers of star formation shows strong correlations with the surface brightness in Halpha and the R band: low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies have lower F Halpha/f FUV ratios compared to high surface brightness galaxies as well as compared to expectations from equilibrium models of constant star formation rate (SFR) using commonly favored IMF parameters. Weaker but significant correlations of F Halpha/f FUV with luminosity, rotational velocity, and dynamical mass as well as a systematic trend with morphology, are found. The correlated variations of F Halpha/f FUV with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family of galaxy scaling relations. The F Halpha/f FUV correlations cannot be due to residual extinction correction errors, while systematic variations in the star formation history (SFH) cannot explain the trends with both Halpha and R surface brightness nor with other global properties. The possibility that LSB galaxies have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photons seems inconsistent with their high gas fraction, and observations of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of a few systems which indicate a real deficit of O stars. The most plausible explanation for the correlations is the systematic variations of the upper mass limit M_u and/or the slope gamma which define the upper end of the IMF. We outline a scenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of the formation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars preferentially form. Our results imply that the SFR measured in a galaxy is highly sensitive to the tracer used in the measurement. A nonuniversal IMF would also call into question the interpretation of metal abundance patterns in dwarf galaxies as well as SFHs derived from CMDs.

	Abstract = {We have analysed near-infrared NTT/SofI observations of the starburst cluster Westerlund 1, which is among the most massive young clusters in the Milky Way. A comparison of colour-magnitude diagrams with theoretical main-sequence and pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks yields improved extinction and distance estimates of AKs = 1.13 $\pm$ 0.03 mag and d = 3.55 $\pm$ 0.17 kpc (DM = 12.75 $\pm$ 0.10 mag). The pre-main sequence population is best fit by a Palla & Stahler isochrone for an age of 3.2 Myr, while the main sequence population is in agreement with a cluster age of 3 to 5 Myr. An analysis of the structural parameters of the cluster yields that the half-mass radius of the cluster population increases towards lower mass, indicative of the presence of mass segregation. The cluster is clearly elongated with an eccentricity of 0.20 for stars with masses between 10 and 32 M_&sun;, and 0.15 for stars with masses in the range 3 to 10 M_&sun;. We derive the slope of the stellar mass function for stars with masses between 3.4 and 27 M_&sun;. In an annulus with radii between 0.75 and 1.5 pc from the cluster centre, we obtain a slope of Gamma = -1.3. Closer in, the mass function of Westerlund 1 is shallower with Gamma = -0.6. The extrapolation of the mass function for stars with masses from 0.08 to 120 M_&sun; yields an initial total stellar mass of ≈52 000 M_&sun;, and a present-day mass of 20 000 to 45 000 M_&sun; (about 10 times the stellar mass of the Orion nebula cluster, and 2 to 4 times the mass of the NGC 3603 young cluster), indicating that Westerlund 1 is the most massive starburst cluster identified to date in the Milky Way.

	Abstract = {Massive stellar clusters are the best available laboratories to study the mass function of stars. Based on NTT/SofI near-infrared photometry, we have investigated the properties of the massive young cluster Westerlund 1. From comparison with stellar models, we derived an extinction ? mag, an age tau= 4 $\pm$ 0.5 Myr and a distance d= 4.0 $\pm$ 0.2 kpc for Westerlund 1, as well as a total mass of ?. Using spatially-dependent completeness corrections, we performed a two-dimensional study of the cluster's initial mass function (IMF) and, in addition, of the stellar density profiles of the cluster as a function of mass. From both IMF slope variations and stellar density, we find strong evidence of mass segregation. For a cluster with some 105 stars, this is not expected at such a young age as the result of two-body relaxation alone. We also confirm previous findings on the elongation of Westerlund 1; assuming an elliptical density profile, we found an axial ratio of a:b= 3:2. Rapid mass segregation and elongation could be well explained as the results of subclusters merging during the formation of Westerlund 1. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile, and retrieved from the ESO archive (Program ID 67.C-0514).},

	Abstract = {We study the initial mass function (IMF) of one of the most massive Galactic star-forming regions NGC 3603 to answer a fundamental question in current astrophysics: is the IMF universal, or does it vary? Using our very deep, high angular resolution JHKSL' images obtained with NAOS-CONICA at the VLT at ESO, we have successfully revealed the stellar population down to the subsolar mass range in the core of the starburst cluster. The derived IMF of NGC 3603 is reasonably fitted by a single power law with index Gamma~-0.74 within a mass range of 0.4-20 Msolar, substantially flatter than the Salpeter-like IMF. A strong radial steepening of the IMF is observed mainly in the inner r<~30'' field, indicating mass segregation in the cluster center. We estimate the total mass of NGC 3603 to be about 1.0-1.6×104 Msolar. The derived core density is >=6×104 Msolar pc-3, an order of magnitude larger than, e.g., the Orion Nebula Cluster. The estimate of the half-mass relaxation time for solar-mass stars is about 10-40 Myr, suggesting that the intermediate- and low-mass stars have not yet been affected significantly by the dynamical relaxation in the cluster. The relaxation time for the high-mass stars can be comparable to the age of the cluster. We estimate that the stars residing outside the observed field cannot steepen the IMF significantly, indicating our IMF adequately describes the whole cluster. Analyzing thoroughly the systematic uncertainties in our IMF determination, we conclude that the power-law index of the IMF of NGC 3603 is Gamma=-0.74+0.62-0.47. Our result thus supports the hypothesis of a potential top-heavy IMF in massive star-forming clusters and starbursts.  Based on observations obtained at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) on Paranal, Chile, under programs 70.C-0490 and 74.C-0764 (NACO), and on observations from the ESO archive (ISAAC).},

	Abstract = {Most of what we know about the stellar population of nearby, resolved galaxies comes from the interpretation of their color-magnitude diagrams, by comparison with stellar evolutionary models. We review how well current stellar evolution models reproduce the properties of simple stellar populations. Emphasis is given to the regions of the color-magnitude diagram which are most useful for deriving age, metallicity, or distance of a population. Extensive comparison is made between the predictions of the most-used stellar evolution libraries, in order to estimate how model dependent the results are. The present review, written from a user perspective, aims at emphasizing the strengths and weaknesses of the models, and is intended both for observers and theoreticians. We hope to encourage observers to provide stronger observational constraints where they are needed, and to stimulate theoreticians to isolate the input physics responsible for the different behavior between models and the reasons for the discrepancies with data.},

@article{Mayne:2008zr,
	Abstract = {We use several main-sequence models to derive distances (and extinctions), with statistically meaningful uncertainties for 11 star-forming regions and young clusters. The model dependency is shown to be small, allowing us to adopt the distances derived using one model. Using these distances, we have revised the age order for some of the clusters of Mayne et al. The new nominal ages are: ~2 Myr for NGC 6530 and the ONC, ~3 Myr for lambda Orionis, NGC 2264 and sigma Orionis, ~4-5 Myr for NGC 2362, ~13 Myr for h and chi Per, ~20 Myr for NGC 1960 and ~40 Myr for NGC 2547. In cases of significantly variable extinction, we have derived individual extinctions using a revised Q-method. These new data show that the largest remaining uncertainty in deriving an age ordering (and necessarily ages) is metallicity. We also discuss the use of a feature we term the radiative-convective gap overlap to provide a diagnostic of isochronal age spreads or varying accretion histories within a given star formation region. Finally, recent derivations of the distance to the ONC lie in two groups. Our new more precise distance of 391+12-9 pc allows us to decisively reject the further distance; we adopt 400 pc as a convenient value.},

@article{Covey:2010xy,
	Abstract = {We have investigated the stellar content of Barnard 59 (B59), the most active star-forming core in the Pipe Nebula. Using the SpeX spectrograph on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, we obtained moderate resolution, near-infrared (NIR) spectra for 20 candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) in B59 and a representative sample of NIR and mid-IR bright sources distributed throughout the Pipe. Measuring luminosity and temperature sensitive features in these spectra, we identified likely background giant stars and measured each star's spectral type, extinction, and NIR continuum excess. To measure B59's age, we place its candidate YSOs in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and compare their location to YSOs in several well-studied star-forming regions, as well as predictions of pre-main-sequence (PMS) evolutionary models. We find that B59 is composed of late-type (K4-M6) low-mass (0.9-0.1 M sun) YSOs whose median stellar age is comparable to, if not slightly older than, that of YSOs within the rho Oph, Taurus, and Chameleon star-forming regions. Deriving absolute age estimates from PMS models computed by D'Antona et al., and accounting only for statistical uncertainties, we measure B59's median stellar age to be 2.6 $\pm$ 0.8 Myr. Including potential systematic effects increases the error budget for B59's median (DM98) stellar age to 2.6+4.1 -2.6 Myr. We also find that the relative age orderings implied by PMS evolutionary tracks depend on the range of stellar masses sampled, as model isochrones possess significantly different mass dependences. The maximum likelihood median stellar age we measure for B59, and the region's observed gas properties, suggests that the B59 dense core has been stable against global collapse for roughly six dynamical timescales and is actively forming stars with a star formation efficiency per dynamical time of ~6%. While the ~150% uncertainties associated with our age measurement propagate directly into these derived star formation timescales, the maximum likelihood values nonetheless agree well with recent star formation simulations that incorporate various forms of support against collapse, such as subcritical magnetic fields, outflows, and radiative feedback from protostellar heating.},

	Abstract = {This overview summarizes the age dating methods available for young sub-solar mass stars. Pre-main sequence age diagnostics include the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, spectroscopic surface gravity indicators, and lithium depletion; asteroseismology is also showing recent promise. Near and beyond the zero-age main sequence, rotation period or vsini and activity (coronal and chromospheric) diagnostics along with lithium depletion serve as age proxies. Other authors in this volume present more detail in each of the aforementioned areas. Herein, I focus on pre-main sequence HR diagrams and address the questions: Do empirical young cluster isochrones match theoretical isochrones? Do isochrones predict stellar ages consistent with those derived via other independent techniques? Do the observed apparent luminosity spreads at constant effective temperature correspond to true age spreads? While definitive answers to these questions are not provided, some methods of progression are outlined.},

	Abstract = {In performing a Bayesian analysis of astronomical data, two difficult problems often emerge. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit pronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods. Secondly, in selecting between a set of competing models, calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally expensive using existing methods such as thermodynamic integration. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling, has greatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidence and also produces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied successfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee, Parkinson & Liddle, but their implementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced degeneracies. Shaw, Bridges & Hobson recently introduced a clustered nested sampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling from multimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the final evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further increase in efficiency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and present three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from distributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies in very high dimensions; we also present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty on the evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement in sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to two toy problems to demonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter estimation. Finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing Bayesian object detection in astronomical data sets, and show that they significantly outperform existing MCMC techniques. An implementation of our methods will be publicly released shortly.},

	Abstract = {Pre-main sequence evolutionary theory is not well-calibrated to observations.  With care, the observed quantities can be converted into effective temperature and luminosity (i.e. the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram) which the theoretical calculations also predict as a function of stellar mass and age. For a sample of nearby young stellar clusters and associations ranging in age from <1 Myr to >100  Myr, we have tested the loci of luminosity as a function of effective temperature against various sets of predicted pre-main sequence isochrones.  As we found in Hillenbrand & White (2004) which tested stellar masses, here for the stellar ages there are two conclusions: some evolutionary calculations fare better than others in reproducing the empirical sequences, and systematic differences between all pre-main sequence evolutionary calculations and the data are apparent.  We also simulate hypothetical clusters of varying star formation history and compare the resulting HR diagram predictions to observed clusters. Our efforts are directed towards quantitative assessment of apparent luminosity spreads in star forming regions and young clusters, which are often erroneously interpreted as true luminosity spreads indicative of true age spreads.},

	Abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Near-Infrared Camera and Multiobject Spectrometer (NICMOS) observations as evidence that continuous star formation has created much of the central stellar cusp of the Galaxy. The data are the deepest ever obtained for a Galactic center population, being more than 50% complete for mF205W<19.3, or initial stellar masses >~2 Msolar. We use Geneva and Padova stellar evolution models to produce synthetic luminosity functions for burst and continuous star formation scenarios, finding that the observations are fitted best by continuous star formation at a rate that is consistent with the recent star formation activity that produced the three massive young clusters in the central 50 pc. Further, it is not possible to fit the observations with ancient burst models, such as would be appropriate for an old population like that in Baade's window or NGC 6528.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of 19 hot, evolved, massive stars near the Galactic center region (GCR). These objects were selected for spectroscopy owing to their detection as strong sources of Paschen-alpha (Palpha) emission-line excess, following a narrowband imaging survey of the central 0fdg65 × 0fdg25 (l, b) around Sgr A* with the Hubble Space Telescope. Discoveries include six carbon-type (WC) and five nitrogen-type (WN) Wolf-Rayet stars, six O supergiants, and two B supergiants. Two of the O supergiants have X-ray counterparts having properties consistent with solitary O stars and colliding-wind binaries. The infrared photometry of 17 stars is consistent with the Galactic center distance, but 2 of them are located in the foreground. Several WC stars exhibit a relatively large infrared excess, which is possibly thermal emission from hot dust. Most of the stars appear scattered throughout the GCR, with no relation to the three known massive young clusters; several others lie near the Arches and Quintuplet clusters and may have originated within one of these systems. The results of this work bring the total sample of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the GCR to 88. All sources of strong Palpha excess have been identified in the area surveyed with HST, which implies that the sample of WN stars in this region is near completion, and is dominated by late (WNL) types. The current WC sample, although probably not complete, is almost exclusively dominated by late (WCL) types. The observed WR subtype distribution in the GCR is a reflection of the intrinsic rarity of early subtypes (WNE and WCE) in the inner Galaxy, an effect that is driven by metallicity.},

	Abstract = {We present further development and the first public release of our multimodal nested sampling algorithm, called MULTINEST. This Bayesian inference tool calculates the evidence, with an associated error estimate, and produces posterior samples from distributions that may contain multiple modes and pronounced (curving) degeneracies in high dimensions. The developments presented here lead to further substantial improvements in sampling efficiency and robustness, as compared to the original algorithm presented in Feroz & Hobson, which itself significantly outperformed existing Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques in a wide range of astrophysical inference problems. The accuracy and economy of the MULTINEST algorithm are demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focusing on the extension of the vanilla Lambda cold dark matter model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy. The MULTINEST software, which is fully parallelized using MPI and includes an interface to COSMOMC, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/. It will also be released as part of the SUPERBAYES package, for the analysis of supersymmetric theories of particle physics, at http://www.superbayes.org.},

	Abstract = {Whilst young massive clusters (YMCs; $M$ $\gtrsim$ 10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$, age $\lesssim$ 100 Myr) have been identified in significant numbers, their progenitor gas clouds have eluded detection. Recently, four extreme molecular clouds residing within 200 pc of the Galactic centre have been identified as having the properties thought necessary to form YMCs. Here we utilise far-IR continuum data from the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (HiGAL) and millimetre spectral line data from the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz Survey (MALT90) to determine their global physical and kinematic structure. We derive their masses, dust temperatures and radii and use virial analysis to conclude that they are all likely gravitationally bound -- confirming that they are likely YMC progenitors. We then compare the density profiles of these clouds to those of the gas and stellar components of the Sagittarius B2 Main and North proto-clusters and the stellar distribution of the Arches YMC. We find that even in these clouds -- the most massive and dense quiescent clouds in the Galaxy -- the gas is not compact enough to form an Arches-like ($M$ = 2x10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$, R$_{eff}$ = 0.4 pc) stellar distribution. Further dynamical processes would be required to condense the resultant population, indicating that the mass becomes more centrally concentrated as the (proto)-cluster evolves. These results suggest that YMC formation may proceed hierarchically rather than through monolithic collapse.},

@article{Kupper:2010ek,
	Abstract = {Based on our recent work on tidal tails of star clusters we investigate star clusters of a few 104Msolar by means of velocity dispersion profiles and surface density profiles. We use a comprehensive set of N-body computations of star clusters on various orbits within a realistic tidal field to study the evolution of these profiles with time, and ongoing cluster dissolution. From the velocity dispersion profiles we find that the population of potential escapers, i.e. energetically unbound stars inside the Jacobi radius, dominates clusters at radii above about 50 per cent of the Jacobi radius. Beyond 70 per cent of the Jacobi radius nearly all stars are energetically unbound. The velocity dispersion therefore significantly deviates from the predictions of simple equilibrium models in this regime. We furthermore argue that for this reason this part of a cluster cannot be used to detect a dark matter halo or deviations from the Newtonian gravity. By fitting templates to about 104 computed surface density profiles we estimate the accuracy which can be achieved in reconstructing the Jacobi radius of a cluster in this way. We find that the template of King works well for extended clusters on nearly circular orbits, but shows significant flaws in the case of eccentric cluster orbits. This we fix by extending this template with three more free parameters. Our template can reconstruct the tidal radius over all fitted ranges with an accuracy of about 10 per cent, and is especially useful in the case of cluster data with a wide radial coverage and for clusters showing significant extra-tidal stellar populations. No other template that we have tried can yield comparable results over this range of cluster conditions. All templates fail to reconstruct tidal parameters of concentrated clusters, however. Moreover, we find that the bulk of a cluster adjusts to the mean tidal field which it experiences and not to the tidal field at perigalacticon as has often been assumed in other investigations, i.e. a fitted tidal radius is a cluster's time average mean tidal radius and not its perigalactic one. Furthermore, we study the tidal debris in the vicinity of the clusters and find it to be well represented by a power law with a slope of -4 to -5. This steep slope we ascribe to the epicyclic motion of escaped stars in the tidal tails. Star clusters close to apogalacticon show a significantly shallower slope of up to -1, however. We suggest that clusters at apogalacticon can be identified by measuring this slope.},

	Abstract = {We present a proper-motion, CCD photometric study of stars in the distant halo globular cluster Palomar 13. The absolute proper motion of Pal 13 with respect to the background galaxies, derived from moderate-scale photographic plates separated by a 40 year baseline, is (mualphacosdelta,mudelta)=(2.30,0.27)+/- (0.26,0.25) mas yr-1. The resultant total space velocity (315 km s-1) implies that Pal 13 is in the inner part of its orbit near perigalacticon. Orbital integration reveals that the cluster possesses an inclined, very eccentric, retrograde orbit. These data confirm that Pal 13 is a paradigm ``young halo'' globular cluster. The derived proper motions for cluster stars are used to produce membership probabilities and a cleaned CCD UBV catalog for Pal 13. With this data set we have made small revisions to Pal 13's distance, metallicity, position, and light profile. The membership of four previously reported RR Lyrae variables and a disproportionately large group of blue straggler stars is confirmed. As expected, the blue stragglers are centrally concentrated. The small size of this cluster, combined with the shape of its light profile, which shows a clear departure from a classical King function beyond the tidal radius, suggests that Pal 13 is in the final throes of destruction. This could explain the large blue straggler specific frequency, as destructive processes would preferentially strip less massive stars.},

	Abstract = {The tidal evolution of globular clusters subject to various degrees of the internal diffusion process is investigated. In cases of negligible diffusion, clusters are found to be tidally truncated to the theoretical tidal radius at perigalacticon. There is no apparent orbital phase dependence of the tidal radius for clusters with eccentric orbits. In clusters with moderately short two-body relaxation time scales, diffusion processes significantly modify the structure of the outer regions in such a way that the limiting radius may be comparable to the tidal radius at apogalacticon. The Galactical tidal torque induces isotropy in the velocity dispersion of the outer regions of the cluster. For relaxed clusters, the velocity dispersion may be isotropic in the core, anisotropic in the envelope and isotropic near the limiting radius. Disk shocking is also very efficient for isotropizing the orbits of stars in the outer cluster regions. Stars with direct orbits are less stable, so that prolonged tidal interaction can lead to apparent retrograde rotation in the outer regions of the cluster.},

In this model there is a minimum energy below which stars cannot escape. Above this energy, however, the time-scale on which a star escapes varies with the orbital parameters of the star (mainly its energy) in a way which we attempt to quantify, with both theoretical arguments and computer simulations. Within the limitations of the model we show that the time-scale is long enough to complicate the interpretation of full N-body simulations of clusters, and that stars above the escape energy may remain bound to the cluster for about a Hubble time.},

@article{Hills:2015bh,
	Abstract = {This paper provides a detailed comparison of the differences in parameters derived for a star cluster from its color-magnitude diagrams depending on the filters and models used. We examine the consistency and reliability of fitting three widely-used stellar evolution models to fifteen combinations of optical and near-IR photometry for the old open cluster NGC 188. The optical filter response curves match those of the theoretical systems and are thus not the source of fit inconsistencies. NGC 188 is ideally suited to the present study thanks to a wide variety of high-quality photometry and available proper motions and radial velocities which enable us to remove non-cluster members and many binaries. Our Bayesian fitting technique yields inferred values of age, metallicity, distance modulus, and absorption as a function of the photometric band combinations and stellar models. We show that the historically-favored three band combinations of UBV and VRI can be meaningfully inconsistent with each other and with longer baseline datasets such as UBVRIJHKs. Differences among model sets can also be substantial. For instance, fitting Yi et al. (2001) and Dotter et al. (2008) models to UBVRIJHKs photometry for NGC 188 yields the following cluster parameters: age={5.78+ 0.03, 6.45+-0.04} Gyr, [Fe/H]={+0.125+-0.003, -0.077+-0.003} dex, m-M={11.441+-0.007, 11.525+-0.005} mag, and Av={0.162+-0.003, 0.236+-0.003} mag, respectively. Within the formal fitting errors, these two fits are substantially and statistically different. Such differences amongst fits using different filters and models are a cautionary tale regarding our current ability to fit star cluster color-magnitude diagrams. Additional modeling of this kind, with more models and star clusters, and future GAIA parallaxes are critical for isolating and quantifying the most relevant uncertainties in stellar evolutionary models.},

@article{Penarrubia:2009pd,
	Abstract = {We use N-body simulations to explore the effects of tidal stripping on the structure of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our models assume cosmologically motivated initial conditions where dSphs are modeled as King spheres, embedded in Navarro-Frenk-White dark halos and orbiting the Galactic potential on eccentric orbits. As expected, systems that orbit through dense regions of the Galaxy lose a significant fraction of stars after each pericentric passage. These episodes of mass loss, however, do not impose a clear tidal cutoff on the bound stellar core. Rather, once equilibrium has been re-established the outer mass profile approaches a power law well described by a simple Plummer model. As noted in earlier work, tides also result in transient features in the outer density profile. As the system relaxes, an outward-moving "excess" of stars is found at radii where the local crossing time exceeds the time elapsed since pericenter. If the orbit of the dSph is known, these results provide a simple way to assess whether "breaks" and "bumps" in the outer profile of dSphs are actually tidal in origin. We apply this to the Sagittarius dwarf and, encouragingly, identify two features in the surface brightness profile that may be traced to its two last pericentric passages. Applied to Leo I, our results predict that any tidal break would occur at radii beyond those surveyed by current data, casting doubt on recent claims of the detection of tidal debris around this galaxy. For Carina, our model indicates that the tidal break should occur at a radius twice farther than observed. This suggests that the outer excess of stars in Carina is not tidal in origin unless its orbit is in error. A similar comment applies to Sculptor, whose pericenter appears too large for Galactic tides to be important but whose outer profile, like that of Draco, nonetheless follows closely a Plummer law. Fornax and Leo II show no sign of a power-law outer profile, suggesting that they have not been significantly affected by tides. Published profiles for other Milky Way dSph companions do not extend sufficiently far to allow for conclusive assessment. Panoramic surveys that extend surface brightness profiles beyond ~10 core radii, together with improved constraints on the orbital parameters of dSphs, are needed in order to establish the true origin of the outer envelopes of stars surrounding dSphs.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a study that uses numerical simulations to interpret observations of tidally disturbed satellites around the Milky Way. When analysing the simulations from the viewpoint of an observer, we find a break in the slope of the star count and velocity dispersion profiles in our models at the location where unbound stars dominate. We conclude that `extra-tidal' stars and enhanced velocity dispersions observed in the outskirts of Galactic satellites are caused by contamination by stellar debris from the tidal interaction with the Milky Way. However, a significant bound population can exist beyond the break radius and we argue that it should not be identified with the tidal radius of the satellite.  We also develop and test a method for determining the mass-loss rate from a Galactic satellite using its extra-tidal population. We apply this method to observations of globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way, and conclude that a significant fraction of each of these satellite systems is likely to be destroyed within the next Hubble time.  Finally, we demonstrate that this mass-loss estimate allows us to place some limits on the initial mass function (IMF) of stars in a cluster from the radial dependence of its present-day mass function (PDMF).},

@article{Webb:2014ul,
	Abstract = {We use N-body simulations to explore the influence of orbital eccentricity on the dynamical evolution of star clusters. Specifically, we compare the mass-loss rate, velocity dispersion, relaxation time, and the mass function of star clusters on circular and eccentric orbits. For a given perigalactic distance, increasing orbital eccentricity slows the dynamical evolution of a cluster due to a weaker mean tidal field. However, we find that perigalactic passes and tidal heating due to an eccentric orbit can partially compensate for the decreased mean tidal field by energizing stars to higher velocities and stripping additional stars from the cluster, accelerating the relaxation process. We find that the corresponding circular orbit which best describes the evolution of a cluster on an eccentric orbit is much less than its semi-major axis or time-averaged galactocentric distance. Since clusters spend the majority of their lifetimes near apogalacticon, the properties of clusters which appear very dynamically evolved for a given galactocentric distance can be explained by an eccentric orbit. Additionally, we find that the evolution of the slope of the mass function within the core radius is roughly orbit independent, so it could place additional constraints on the initial mass and initial size of globular clusters with solved orbits. We use our results to demonstrate how the orbit of Milky Way globular clusters can be constrained given standard observable parameters like galactocentric distance and the slope of the mass function. We then place constraints on the unsolved orbits of NGC 1261, NGC 6352, NGC 6496, and NGC 6304 based on their positions and mass functions.},

(1995) and in the treatment of the boundary condition. Comparisons of our models with other grids demonstrate the validity of this EOS in the domain of very low-mass stars. Finally, we present a new server dedicated to PMS stellar evolution which allows the determination of stellar parameters from observational data, the calculation of isochrones, the retrieval of evolutionary files and the possibility to generate graphic outputs.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of globular clusters due to two-body relaxation results in an outward flow of energy and at some stage all clusters need a central energy source to sustain their evolution. H{\'e}non provided the insight that we do not need to know the details of the energy production in order to understand the relaxation-driven evolution of the cluster, at least outside the core. He provided two self-similar solutions for the evolution of clusters based on the view that the cluster as a whole determines the amount of energy that is produced in the core: steady expansion for isolated clusters, and homologous contraction for clusters evaporating in a tidal field. The amount of expansion or evaporation per relaxation time-scale is set by the instantaneous radius or number of stars, respectively. We combine these two approximate models and propose a pair of Unified Equations of Evolution (UEE) for the life cycle of initially compact clusters in a tidal field. The half-mass radius increases during the first part (roughly half) of the evolution, and decreases in the second half, while the escape rate approaches a constant value set by the tidal field. We refer to these phases as 'expansion dominated' and 'evaporation dominated'. These simple analytical solutions of the UEE immediately allow us to construct evolutionary tracks and isochrones in terms of cluster half-mass density, cluster mass and galactocentric radius. From a comparison to the Milky Way globular clusters we find that roughly one-third of them are in the second, evaporation-dominated phase and for these clusters the density inside the half-mass radius varies with the galactocentric distance RG as rhoh∝R-2G. The remaining two-thirds are still in the first, expansion-dominated phase and their isochrones follow the environment-independent scaling rhoh∝M2, where M is the cluster mass; that is, a constant relaxation time-scale. We find substantial agreement between Milky Way globular cluster parameters and the isochrones, which suggests that there is, as H{\'e}non suggested, a balance between the flow of energy and the central energy production for almost all globular clusters.},

	Abstract = {Using deep photometric data from Wide Field Camera at the Isaac Newton Telescope and Wide Field Imager at the ESO 2.2-m telescope we measure the outer number density profiles of 19 stellar clusters located in the inner region of the Milky Way halo (within a Galactocentric distance range of 10-30 kpc) in order to assess the impact of internal and external dynamical processes on the spatial distribution of stars. Adopting power-law fitting templates, with index -gamma in the outer region, we find that the clusters in our sample can be divided in two groups: a group of massive clusters (>=105 M&sun;) that has relatively flat profiles with 2.5 < gamma < 4, and a group of low-mass clusters (<=105 M&sun;), with steep profiles (gamma > 4) and clear signatures of interaction with the Galactic tidal field. We refer to these two groups as 'tidally unaffected' and 'tidally affected', respectively. Our results also show a clear trend between the slope of the outer parts and the half-mass density of these systems, which suggests that the outer density profiles may retain key information on the dominant processes driving the dynamical evolution of globular clusters.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the spatial density configuration of stars around four metal-poor globular clusters (NGC 6266, NGC 6626, NGC 6642, and NGC 6723) in the Galactic bulge region using wide-field deep J, H, and K imaging data obtained with the Wide Field Camera near-infrared array on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. A statistical weighted filtering algorithm for the stars on the color-magnitude diagram is applied in order to sort cluster member candidates from the field star contamination. In two-dimensional isodensity contour maps of the clusters, we find that all four of the globular clusters exhibit strong evidence of tidally stripped stellar features beyond the tidal radius in the form of tidal tails or small density lobes/chunks. The orientations of the extended stellar substructures are likely to be associated with the effect of dynamic interaction with the Galaxy and the cluster's space motion. The observed radial density profiles of the four globular clusters also describe the extended substructures; they depart from theoretical King and Wilson models and have an overdensity feature with a break in the slope of the profile at the outer region of clusters. The observed results could imply that four globular clusters in the Galactic bulge region have experienced strong environmental effects such as tidal forces or bulge/disk shocks of the Galaxy during the dynamical evolution of globular clusters. These observational results provide further details which add to our understanding of the evolution of clusters in the Galactic bulge region as well as the formation of the Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {The ACS Survey of Globular Clusters has used Hubble Space Telescope's Wide-Field Channel to obtain uniform imaging of 65 of the nearest globular clusters to provide an extensive homogeneous data set for a broad range of scientific investigations. The survey goals required not only a uniform observing strategy, but also a uniform reduction strategy. To this end, we designed a sophisticated software program to process the cluster data in an automated way. The program identifies stars simultaneously in the multiple dithered exposures for each cluster and measures them using the best available point-spread function models. We describe here in detail the program's rationale, algorithms, and output. The routine was also designed to perform artificial-star tests, and we ran a standard set of ~105 tests for each cluster in the survey. The catalog described here will be exploited in a number of upcoming papers and will eventually be made available to the public via the World Wide Web.

	Abstract = {We fit the colour-magnitude diagrams of stars between the zero-age main-sequence and terminal-age main sequence in young clusters and associations. The ages we derive are a factor of 1.5-2 longer than the commonly used ages for these regions, which are derived from the positions of pre-main-sequence stars in colour-magnitude diagrams. From an examination of the uncertainties in the main-sequence and pre-main-sequence models, we conclude that the longer age scale is probably the correct one, which implies that we must revise upwards the commonly used ages for young clusters and associations. Such a revision would explain the discrepancy between the observational lifetimes of protoplanetary discs and theoretical calculations of the time to form planets. It would also explain the absence of clusters with ages between 5 and 30Myr.  We use the tau2 statistic to fit the main-sequence data, but find that we must make significant modifications if we are to fit sequences which have vertical segments in the colour-magnitude diagram. We present this modification along with improvements to the methods of calculating the goodness-of-fit statistic and parameter uncertainties.  Software implementing the methods described in this paper is available from http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/timn/tau-squared/.},

	Abstract = {Palla & Stahler have recently argued that star formation in Taurus and other nearby molecular clouds extends over a period of at least 10 Myr, implying quasi-static cloud evolution and star formation. Their conclusions contradict other recent results indicating that molecular clouds are transient objects and star formation proceeds rapidly. The Palla & Stahler picture implies that most molecular clouds should have extremely low rates of star formation and that in such inactive stages, the stellar initial mass function (IMF) should be strongly skewed toward producing stars with masses >~1Msolar neither prediction is supported by observations. I show that the Palla & Stahler conclusions for Taurus depend almost entirely on a small number of stars with masses >~1Msolar the lower mass stars show no evidence for such an extended period of star formation. I further show that most of the stars apparently older than 10 Myr in the direction of Taurus are probably foreground nonmembers. I also present birth line calculations that support the idea that the ages of the stars with masses >~1Msolar have been systematically overestimated because birth line age corrections have been underestimated; such birth lines would eliminate the need to postulate skewed IMFs. The simplest and most robust explanation of current observations characterizing the vast majority of young stars in molecular clouds is that cloud and star formation is rapid and dynamic.},

	Abstract = {We report Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Near-Infrared Camera and Multiobject Spectrometer (NICMOS) observations of the Arches and Quintuplet clusters, two extraordinary young clusters near the Galactic center. For the first time, we have identified main-sequence stars in the Galactic center with initial masses well below 10 Msolar. We present the first determination of the initial mass function (IMF) for any population in the Galactic center, finding an IMF slope that is significantly more positive (Gamma~-0.65) than the average for young clusters elsewhere in the Galaxy (Gamma~-1.4). The apparent turnoffs in the color-magnitude diagrams suggest cluster ages that are consistent with the ages implied by the mixture of spectral types in the clusters; we find tauage~2+/-1 Myr for the Arches cluster and tauage~4+/-1 Myr for the Quintuplet. We estimate total cluster masses by adding the masses of observed stars down to the 50% completeness limit and then extrapolating down to a lower mass cutoff of 1 Msolar. Using this method, we find >~104 Msolar for the total mass of the Arches cluster. Such a determination for the Quintuplet cluster is complicated by the double-valued mass-magnitude relationship for clusters with ages >~3 Myr. We find a lower limit of 6300 Msolar for the total cluster mass and suggest a best estimate of twice this value, which accounts for the outlying members of the cluster. Both clusters have masses that place them as the two most massive young clusters in the Galaxy.

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the ages and star formation history of the F-type stars in the Upper Scorpius (US), Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL), and Lower Centaurus-Crux (LCC) subgroups of Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen), the nearest OB association. Our parent sample is the kinematically selected Hipparcos sample of de Zeeuw et al., restricted to the 138 F-type members. We have obtained classification-resolution optical spectra and have also determined the spectroscopic accretion disk fraction. With Hipparcos and 2MASS photometry, we estimate the reddening and extinction for each star and place the candidate members on a theoretical H-R diagram. For each subgroup we construct empirical isochrones and compare to published evolutionary tracks. We find that (1) our empirical isochrones are consistent with the previously published age-rank of the Sco-Cen subgroups; (2) subgroups LCC and UCL appear to reach the main-sequence turn-on at spectral types ~F4 and ~F2, respectively. An analysis of the A-type stars shows US reaching the main sequence at about spectral type ~A3. (3) The median ages for the pre-main-sequence members of UCL and LCC are 16 Myr and 17 Myr, respectively, in agreement with previous studies, however we find that (4) Upper Sco is much older than previously thought. The luminosities of the F-type stars in US are typically a factor of ~2.5 less luminous than predicted for a 5 Myr old population for four sets of evolutionary tracks. We re-examine the evolutionary state and isochronal ages for the B-, A-, and G-type Upper Sco members, as well as the evolved M supergiant Antares, and estimate a revised mean age for Upper Sco of 11 $\pm$ 1 $\pm$ 2 Myr (statistical, systematic). Using radial velocities and Hipparcos parallaxes we calculate a lower limit on the kinematic expansion age for Upper Sco of >10.5 Myr (99% confidence). However, the data are statistically consistent with no expansion. We reevaluate the inferred masses for the known substellar companions in Upper Sco using the revised age and find that the inferred masses are typically ~20%-70% higher than the original estimates which had assumed a much younger age; specifically, we estimate the mass of 1RXS J1609-2105b to be 14+2 -3 M Jup, suggesting that it is a brown dwarf rather than a planet. Finally, we find the fraction of F-type stars exhibiting Halpha emission and/or a K-band excess consistent with accretion to be 0/17 (<19% 95% CL) in US at ~11 Myr, while UCL has 1/41 (2+5 -1% 68% CL) accretors and LCC has 1/50 (2+4 -1% 68% CL) accretors at ~16 Myr and ~17 Myr, respectively.},

	Abstract = {We have derived ages for 13 young (<30 Myr) star-forming regions and find that they are up to a factor of 2 older than the ages typically adopted in the literature. This result has wide-ranging implications, including that circumstellar discs survive longer (~= 10-12 Myr) and that the average Class I lifetime is greater (~=1 Myr) than currently believed. For each star-forming region, we derived two ages from colour-magnitude diagrams. First, we fitted models of the evolution between the zero-age main sequence and terminal-age main sequence to derive a homogeneous set of main-sequence ages, distances and reddenings with statistically meaningful uncertainties. Our second age for each star-forming region was derived by fitting pre-main-sequence stars to new semi-empirical model isochrones. For the first time (for a set of clusters younger than 50 Myr), we find broad agreement between these two ages, and since these are derived from two distinct mass regimes that rely on different aspects of stellar physics, it gives us confidence in the new age scale. This agreement is largely due to our adoption of empirical colour-Teff relations and bolometric corrections for pre-main-sequence stars cooler than 4000 K. The revised ages for the star-forming regions in our sample are: ˜2 Myr for NGC 6611 (Eagle Nebula; M 16), IC 5146 (Cocoon Nebula), NGC 6530 (Lagoon Nebula; M 8) and NGC 2244 (Rosette Nebula); ˜6 Myr for sigma Ori, Cep OB3b and IC 348; ~=10 Myr for lambda Ori (Collinder 69); ~=11 Myr for NGC 2169; ~=12 Myr for NGC 2362; ~=13 Myr for NGC 7160; ~=14 Myr for chi Per (NGC 884); and ~=20 Myr for NGC 1960 (M 36).},

	Abstract = {The membership of Wolf-Rayet stars in open clusters and OB associations is used to determine the initial mass Mi of stars becoming WR stars. A detailed discussion of the relation between the spectral types of the cluster turnoff and the initial mass of WR stars is made on the basis of stellar models. Lower limits 18 solar mass for WN stars and 35 solar mass for WC stars are obtained. From the study of WR stars in clusters and associations evolutionary connections are established between WR subtypes. The most massive stars (Mi greater than about 60 solar mass) evolve via WN7 into WC4-WC8 stars. In the mass range Mi = 35-60 solar mass an evolutionary sequence WN5, WN6 to WC8.5, WC9 to WO is found. From initial masses lower than 35 solar mass mainly WN3, WN4, and WN5 stars can be formed. Binary evolution appears to have a negligible effect on the lower limit of initial mass but introduces a systematic deviation into the evolutionary sequences mentioned above. Particularly, the WR subtypes formed by close binaries are generally earlier than those formed by single stars of the same initial mass.},

@article{Massey:2001ta,
	Abstract = {In a previous paper on the Magellanic Clouds, we demonstrated that coeval clusters provide a powerful tool for probing the progenitor masses of Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars and luminous blue variables (LBVs). Here we extend this work to the higher metallicity regions of the Milky Way, studying 12 Galactic clusters. We present new spectral types for the unevolved stars and use these, plus data from the literature, to construct H-R diagrams. We find that all but two of the clusters are highly coeval, with the highest mass stars having formed over a period of less than 1 Myr. The turnoff masses show that at Milky Way metallicities some W-R stars (of early WN type) come from stars with masses as low as 20-25 Msolar. Other early-type WN stars appears to have evolved from high masses, suggesting that a large range of masses evolve through an early WN stage. On the other hand, WN7 stars are found only in clusters with very high turnoff masses, over 120 Msolar. Similarly, the LBVs are only found in clusters with the highest turnoff masses, as we found in the Magellanic Clouds, providing very strong evidence that LBVs are a normal stage in the evolution of the most massive stars. Although clusters containing WN7 stars and LBVs can be as young as 1 Myr, we argue that these objects are evolved, and that the young age simply reflects the very high masses that characterize the progenitors of such stars. In particular, we show that the LBV eta Car appears to be coeval with the rest of the Trumpler 14/16 complex. Although the WC stars in the Magellanic Clouds were found in clusters with turnoff masses as low as 45 Msolar, the three Galactic WC stars in our sample are all found in clusters with high turnoff masses (>70 Msolar) whether this difference is significant or due to small number statistics remains to be seen. The bolometric corrections of Galactic W-R stars are hard to establish using the cluster turnoff method but are consistent with the ``standard model'' of Hillier.},

@article{Massey:2000if,
	Abstract = {We combine new CCD UBV photometry and spectroscopy with those from the literature to investigate 19 Magellanic Cloud OB associations that contain Wolf-Rayet (W-R) and other types of evolved, massive stars. Our spectroscopy reveals a wealth of newly identified interesting objects, including early O-type supergiants, a high-mass, double-lined binary in the SMC, and, in the LMC, a newly confirmed luminous blue variable (LBV; R85), a newly discovered W-R star (Sk -69$\,^{\circ}$194), and a newly found luminous B[e] star (LH 85-10). We use these data to provide precise reddening determinations and construct physical H-R diagrams for the associations. We find that about half of the associations may be highly coeval, with the massive stars having formed over a short period (Deltatau<1 Myr). The (initial) masses of the highest mass unevolved stars in the coeval clusters may be used to estimate the masses of the progenitors of W-R and other evolved stars found in these clusters. Similarly, the bolometric luminosities of the highest mass unevolved stars can be used to determine the bolometric corrections (BCs) for the evolved stars, providing a valuable observational basis for evaluating recent models of these complicated atmospheres. What we find is the following: (1) Although their numbers is small, it appears that the W-R stars in the SMC come from only the highest mass (greater than 70 Msolar) stars. This is in accord with our expectations that at low metallicities only the most massive and luminous stars will have sufficient mass loss to become W-R stars. (2) In the LMC, the early-type WN (WNE) stars occur in clusters whose turnoff masses range from 30 to 100 Msolar or more. This suggests that possibly all stars with mass greater than 30 Msolar pass through a WNE stage at LMC metallicities. (3) The one WC star in the SMC is found in a cluster with a turnoff mass of 70 Msolar, the same as that for the SMC WN stars. In the LMC, the WC stars are found in clusters with turnoff masses of 45 Msolar or higher, similar to what is found for the LMC WN stars. Thus we conclude that WC stars come from essentially the same mass range as do WN stars and indeed are often found in the same clusters. This has important implications for interpreting the relationship between metallicity and the WC/WN ratio found in Local Group galaxies, which we discuss. (4) The LBVs in our sample come from very high mass stars (greater than 85 Msolar), similar to what is known for the Galactic LBV eta Car, suggesting that only the most massive stars go through an LBV phase. Recently, Ofpe/WN9 stars have been implicated as LBVs after one such star underwent an LBV-like outburst. However, our study includes two Ofpe/WN9 stars, BE 381 and Br 18, which we find in clusters with much lower turnoff masses (25-35 Msolar). We suggest that Ofpe/WN9 stars are unrelated to ``true'' LBVs: not all ``LBV-like outbursts'' may have the same cause. Similarly, the B[e] stars have sometimes been described as LBV-like. Yet, the two stars in our sample appear to come from a large mass range (30-60 Msolar). This is consistent with other studies, suggesting that B[e] stars cover a large range in bolometric luminosities. (5) The bolometric corrections of early WN and WC stars are found to be extreme, with an average BC(WNE) of -6.0 mag and an average BC(WC4) of -5.5 mag. These values are considerably more negative than those of even the hottest O-type stars. However, similar values have been found for WNE stars by applying Hillier's ``standard model'' for W-R atmospheres. We find more modest BCs for the Ofpe/WN9 stars (BC=-2 to -4 mag), also consistent with recent analysis done with the standard model. Extension of these studies to the Galactic clusters will provide insight into how massive stars evolve at different metallicities.},

By studying YMCs with a range of ages (and hence turn-off masses), we can investigate the post main-sequence evolution of massive stars as a function of initial mass. Recent discoveries of YMCs over a range of ages within our own Galaxy---where we can successfully resolve individual stars---offers the unprecedented opportunity to test our ideas of massive stellar evolution. Here, I review some of the recent works in this field, how YMCs both reaffirm our understanding of stellar evolution in some areas, and force us to return to the drawing board in others.},

	Abstract = {We have determined interstellar extinction law toward the Galactic center (GC) at the wavelength from 1.2 to 8.0 mum, using point sources detected in the IRSF/SIRIUS near-infrared (NIR) survey and those in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and Spitzer/IRAC/GLIMPSE II catalogs. The central region midl mid lsim3fdg0 and midb mid lsim1fdg0 has been surveyed in the J, H, and KS bands with the IRSF telescope and the SIRIUS camera whose filters are similar to the Mauna Kea Observatories (MKO) NIR photometric system. Combined with the GLIMPSE II point source catalog, we made KS versus KS - lambda color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) where lambda=3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 mum. The KS magnitudes of bulge red clump stars and the KS - lambda colors of red giant branches are used as a tracer of the reddening vector in the CMDs. From these magnitudes and colors, we have obtained the ratios of total-to-selective extinction A_{K_S}/E_{K_S-lambda} for the four IRAC bands. Combined with A_{lambda}/A_{K_S} for the J and H bands derived by Nishiyama et al., we obtain AJ :AH :A_{K_S}:A [3.6]:A [4.5]:A [5.8]:A [8.0] = 3.02:1.73:1:0.50:0.39:0.36:0.43 for the line of sight toward the GC. This confirms the flattening of the extinction curve at lambda gsim 3 mum from a simple extrapolation of the power-law extinction at shorter wavelengths, in accordance with recent studies. The extinction law in the 2MASS J, H, and KS bands has also been calculated, and good agreement with that in the MKO system is found. Thus, it is established that the extinction in the wavelength range of J, H, and KS is well fitted by a power law of steep decrease A lambda vprop lambda-2.0 toward the GC. In nearby molecular clouds and diffuse interstellar medium, the lack of reliable measurements of the total-to-selective extinction ratios hampers unambiguous determination of the extinction law; however, observational results toward these lines of sight cannot be reconciled with a single extinction law.},

@article{Shanahan:2015db,
	Abstract = {From a study of the integrated light properties of 200 globular clusters (GCs) in M31, Strader et al. found that the mass-to-light ratios are lower than what is expected from simple stellar population (SSP) models with a `canonical' stellar initial mass function (IMF), with the discrepancy being larger at high metallicities. We use dynamical multi-mass models, that include a prescription for equipartition, to quantify the bias in the inferred dynamical mass as the result of the assumption that light follows mass. For a universal IMF and a metallicity dependent present day mass function we find that the inferred mass from integrated light properties systematically under estimates the true mass, and that the bias is more important at high metallicities, as was found for the M31 GCs. We show that mass segregation and a flattening of the mass function have opposing effects of similar magnitude on the mass inferred from integrated properties. This makes the mass-to-light ratio as derived from integrated properties an inadequate probe of the low-mass end of the stellar mass function. There is, therefore, no need for variations in the IMF, nor the need to invoke depletion of low-mass stars, to explain the observations. Finally, we find that the retention fraction of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is an equally important parameter in understanding the mass segregation bias. We speculatively put forward to idea that kinematical data of GCs can in fact be used to constrain the total mass in stellar-mass BHs in GCs.},

@article{Meynet:2000qf,
	Abstract = {Grids of models for rotating stars are constructed in the range of 9 to 120 Msun at solar metallicity. The following effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence, shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2% of the MS lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves during the MS phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior, circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while due to the Gratton-{\"O}pik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation would be inappropriate. After the MS phase, the effects of core contraction and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The surface velocities decrease very much during the MS evolution of the most massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below ~ 12 Msun with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near the end of the MS phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out. For an average rotation, the tracks in the HR diagram are modified like a moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase the MS lifetime up to about 30%; for the helium-burning phase the effects are smaller and amount to at most 10%. From plots of the isochrones, we find that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25% in general. However, for stars with M >~ 40 Msun and fast rotation, a bluewards ``homogeneous-like'' track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g_eff and log T_eff, differences of masses by 30% may easily occur, thus explaining what still remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation. While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses, the present models also well account for the many OB stars exhibiting surface enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. \cite{He92}, \cite{He20}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports the conclusion by Venn (\cite{ve95a}, \cite{Ve99}), that these enrichments mostly result from mixing during the MS phase, which is also in agreement with the results of Lyubimkov (\cite{Lyu96}).},

	Abstract = {Context. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is an essential diagnostic diagram for stellar structure and evolution, which has now been in use for more than 100 years.  Aims: We introduce a new diagram based on the gravity-effective temperature diagram, which has various advantages.  Methods: Our spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell (sHR) diagram shows the inverse of the flux-mean gravity versus the effective temperature. Observed stars whose spectra have been quantitatively analyzed can be entered in this diagram without the knowledge of the stellar distance or absolute brightness.  Results: Observed stars can be as conveniently compared to stellar evolution calculations in the sHR diagram as in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. However, at the same time, our ordinate is proportional to the stellar mass-to-luminosity ratio, which can thus be directly determined. For intermediate- and low-mass star evolution at constant mass, we show that the shape of an evolutionary track in the sHR diagram is identical to that in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We also demonstrate that for hot stars, their stellar Eddington factor can be directly read off the sHR diagram. For stars near their Eddington limit, we argue that a version of the sHR diagram may be useful where the gravity is exchanged by the effective gravity.  Conclusions: We discuss the advantages and limitations of the sHR diagram, and show that it can be fruitfully applied to Galactic stars, but also to stars with known distance, e.g., in the LMC or in galaxies beyond the Local Group.},

@article{Meynet:2003ty,
	Abstract = {We examine the properties of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars predicted by models of rotating stars taking account of the new mass loss rates for O-type stars and WR stars (Vink et al. \cite{Vink00}, \cite{Vink01}; Nugis & Lamers \cite{NuLa00}) and of the wind anisotropies induced by rotation. We find that the rotation velocities v of WR stars are modest, i.e. about 50 km s-1, not very dependent on the initial v and masses. For the most massive stars, the evolution of v is very strongly influenced by the values of the mass loss rates; below  ~ 12 M_sun the evolution of rotation during the MS phase and later phases is dominated by the internal coupling. Massive stars with extreme rotation may skip the LBV phase.  Models having a typical v for the O-type stars have WR lifetimes on the average two times longer than for non-rotating models. The increase of the WR lifetimes is mainly due to that of the H-rich eWNL phase. Rotation allows a transition WN/WC phase to be present for initial masses lower than 60 M_sun. The durations of the other WR subphases are less affected by rotation. The mass threshold for forming WR stars is lowered from 37 to 22 M_sun for typical rotation. The comparisons of the predicted number ratios WR/O, WN/WC and of the number of transition WN/WC stars show very good agreement with models with rotation, while this is not the case for models with the present-day mass loss rates and no rotation. As to the chemical abundances in WR stars, rotation brings only very small changes for WN stars, since they have equilibrium CNO values. However, WC stars with rotation have on average lower C/He and O/He ratios. The luminosity distribution of WC stars is also influenced by rotation.},

	Abstract = {We present and use new spectra and narrowband images, along with previously published broadband images, of stars in the Arches cluster to extract photometry, astrometry, equivalent width, and velocity information. The data are interpreted with a wind/atmosphere code to determine stellar temperatures, luminosities, mass-loss rates, and abundances. We have doubled the number of known emission-line stars, and we have also made the first spectroscopic identification of the main sequence for any population in the Galactic center. We conclude that the most massive stars are bona fide Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars; are some of the most massive stars known, having Minit>100Msolar and have prodigious winds, M>10-5 Msolar yr-1, that are enriched with helium and nitrogen; with these identifications, the Arches cluster contains about 5% of all known W-R stars in the Galaxy. We find an upper limit to the velocity dispersion of 22 km s-1, implying an upper limit to the cluster mass of 7×104 Msolar within a radius of 0.23 pc; we also estimate the bulk heliocentric velocity of the cluster to be vcluster,solar~+95 km s-1. Taken together, these results suggest that the Arches cluster was formed in a short, but massive, burst of star formation about 2.5+/-0.5 Myr ago, from a molecular cloud that is no longer present. The cluster happens to be approaching and ionizing the surface of a background molecular cloud, thus producing the thermal arched filaments. We estimate that the cluster produces 4×1051 ionizing photons s-1, more than enough to account for the observed thermal radio flux from the nearby cloud, 3×1049 ionizing photons s-1. Commensurately, it produces 107.8 Lsolar in total luminosity, providing the heating source for the nearby molecular cloud, Lcloud~107 Lsolar. These interactions between a cluster of hot stars and a wayward molecular cloud are similar to those seen in the ``Quintuplet/Sickle'' region. The small spread of formation times for the known young clusters in the Galactic center and the relative lack of intermediate-age stars (tauage=107.0-107.3 yr) suggest that the Galactic center has recently been host to a burst of star formation. Finally, we have made new identifications of near-infrared sources that are counterparts to recently identified X-ray and radio sources.

	Abstract = {The G305 H II complex (G305.4+0.1) is one of the most massive star-forming structures yet identified within the Galaxy. It is host to many massive stars at all stages of formation and evolution, from embedded molecular cores to post-main-sequence stars. Here, we present a detailed near-infrared analysis of the two central star clusters Danks 1 and Danks 2, using Hubble Space Telescope+NICMOS imaging and Very Large Telescope+ISAAC spectroscopy. We find that the spectrophotometric distance to the clusters is consistent with the kinematic distance to the G305 complex, an average of all measurements giving a distance of 3.8 $\pm$ 0.6 kpc. From analysis of the stellar populations and the pre-main-sequence stars, we find that Danks 2 is the elder of the two clusters, with an age of 3+3- 1 Myr. Danks 1 is clearly younger with an age of 1.5+1.5- 0.5 Myr, and is dominated by three very luminous H-rich Wolf-Rayet stars which may have masses ≳100 M&sun;. The two clusters have mass functions consistent with the Salpeter slope, and total cluster masses of 8000 $\pm$ 1500 and 3000 $\pm$ 800 M&sun; for Danks 1 and Danks 2, respectively. Danks 1 is significantly the more compact cluster of the two, and is one of the densest clusters in the Galaxy with log (rho/M&sun; pc-3) = 5.5+0.5- 0.4. In addition to the clusters, there is a population of apparently isolated Wolf-Rayet stars within the molecular cloud's cavity. Our results suggest that the star-forming history of G305 began with the formation of Danks 2, and subsequently Danks 1, with the origin of the diffuse evolved population currently uncertain. Together, the massive stars at the centre of the G305 region appear to be clearing away what is left of the natal cloud, triggering a further generation of star formation at the cloud's periphery.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we have analyzed 25 Galactic O and early B-stars by means of H and K band spectroscopy, with the primary goal to investigate to what extent a lone near-IR spectroscopy is able to recover stellar and wind parameters derived in the optical. Most of the spectra have been taken with subaru-ircs, at an intermediate resolution of 12 000, and with a very high S/N, mostly on the order of 200 or better. In order to synthesize the strategic H/He lines, we have used our recent, line-blanketed version of fastwind (Puls et al. 2005, A&A, 435, 669). In total, seven lines have been investigated, where for two stars we could make additional use of the Hei2.05 singlet which has been observed with irtf-cshell. Apart from Brgamma and Heii2.18, the other lines are predominately formed in the stellar photosphere, and thus remain fairly uncontaminated from more complex physical processes, particularly clumping. First we investigated the predicted behaviour of the strategic lines. In contradiction to what one expects from the optical in the O-star regime, almost all photospheric H/Hei/Heii H/K band lines become stronger if the gravity decreases. Concerning H and Heii, this finding is related to the behaviour of Stark broadening as a function of electron density, which in the line cores is different for members of lower (optical) and higher (IR) series. Regarding Hei, the predicted behaviour is due to some subtle NLTE effects resulting in a stronger overpopulation of the lower level when the gravity decreases. We have compared our calculations with results from the alternative NLTE model atmosphere code cmfgen (Hillier & Miller 1998, ApJ, 496, 407). In most cases, we found reasonable or nearly perfect agreement. Only the Hei2.05 singlet for mid O-types suffers from some discrepancy, analogous with findings for the optical Hei singlets. For most of our objects, we obtained good fits, except for the line cores of Brgamma in early O-stars with significant mass-loss. Whereas the observations show Brgamma mostly as rather symmetric emission lines, the models predict a P Cygni type profile with strong absorption. This discrepancy (which also appears in lines synthesized by cmfgen) might be an indirect effect of clumping. After having derived the stellar and wind parameters from the IR, we have compared them to results from previous optical analyses. Overall, the IR results coincide in most cases with the optical ones within the typical errors usually quoted for the corresponding parameters, i.e., an uncertainty in T_eff of 5%, in log g of 0.1 dex and in {dot M} of 0.2 dex, with lower errors at higher wind densities. Outliers above the 1-sigma level where found in four cases with respect to log g and in two cases for {dot M}.},

	Abstract = {We present intermediate-resolution (R~8000-12,000) high signal-to-noise (S/N) H- and K-band spectroscopy of a sample of 37 optically visible stars, ranging in spectral type from O3 to B3 and representing most luminosity classes. Spectra of this quality can be used to constrain the temperature, luminosity, and general wind properties of OB stars, when used in conjunction with sophisticated atmospheric model codes. Most important is the need for moderately high resolutions (R>=5000) and very high signal-to-noise (S/N>=150) spectra for a meaningful profile analysis. When using near-infrared spectra for a classification system, moderately high signal-to-noise (S/N~100) is still required, though the resolution can be relaxed to just a thousand or two. In the Appendix we provide a set of very high-quality near-infrared spectra of Brackett lines in six early-A dwarfs. These can be used to aid in the modeling and removal of such lines when early-A dwarfs are used for telluric spectroscopic standards.},

	Abstract = {Based on K-band integral-field spectroscopy, we analyze four Wolf-Rayet stars of the nitrogen sequence (WN) found in the inner part of the Quintuplet cluster. All WN stars (WR 102d, WR 102i, WR 102hb, and WR 102ea) are of spectral subtype WN9h. One further star, LHO 110, is included in the analysis which has been classified as Of/WN? previously but turns out to be most likely a WN9h star as well. The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) models for expanding atmospheres are used to derive the fundamental stellar and wind parameters. The stars turn out to be very luminous, log(L/L_&sun;) > 6.0, with relatively low stellar temperatures, T_* ≈ 25-35 kK. Their stellar winds contain a significant fraction of hydrogen, up to XH ~ 0.45 (by mass). We discuss the position of the Galactic center WN stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and find that they form a distinct group. In this respect, the Quintuplet WN stars are similar to late-type WN stars found in the Arches cluster and elsewhere in the Galaxy. Comparison with stellar evolutionary models reveals that the Quintuplet WN stars should have been initially more massive than 60 M_&sun;. They are about 2.4-3.6 million years old, and might still be central hydrogen burning objects. The analysis of the spectral energy distributions of the program stars results in a mean extinction of AK = 3.1 $\pm$ 0.5 mag (AV = 27 $\pm$ 4 mag) towards the Quintuplet cluster.

	Abstract = {Context: Three very massive clusters are known to reside in the Galactic center region, the Arches cluster, the Quintuplet cluster, and the central parsec cluster, each of them rich in young hot stars. With new infrared instruments, this region is no longer obscured for the observer.  Aims: For understanding these very massive clusters, it is essential to know their stellar inventory. We provide comprehensive spectroscopic data for the stellar population of the Quintuplet cluster that will form the basis of subsequent spectral analyses.  Methods: Spectroscopic observations of the Quintuplet cluster were obtained with the Integral Field Spectrograph SINFONI-SPIFFI at the ESO-VLT. The inner part of the Quintuplet cluster was covered by 22 slightly overlapping fields, each of them of 8 arcsec × 8 arcsec in size. The spectral range comprises the near-IR K-band from 1.94 to 2.45 mum. The 3D data cubes of the individual fields were flux-calibrated and combined to one contiguous cube, from which the spectra of all detectable point sources were extracted.  Results: We present a catalog of 160 stellar sources in the inner part of the Quintuplet cluster. The flux-calibrated K-band spectra of 98 early-type stars and 62 late-type stars are provided as Online Material. Based on these spectra, we assign spectral types to all detected sources and derive synthetic K_s-band magnitudes. Our sample is complete to about the 13th K-magnitude. We report the detection of two hitherto unknown Wolf-Rayet stars of late WC type (WC9 or later). Radial velocities are measured and employed to assess the cluster membership. The quantitative analysis of the early-type spectra will be the subject of a subsequent paper.},

	Abstract = {Massive stars rapidly change their masses through strong stellar winds and mass transfer in binary systems. The latter aspect is important for populations of massive stars as more than 70% of all O stars are expected to interact with a binary companion during their lifetime. We show that such mass changes leave characteristic signatures in stellar mass functions of young star clusters that can be used to infer their ages and to identify products of binary evolution. We model the observed present-day mass functions of the young Galactic Arches and Quintuplet star clusters using our rapid binary evolution code. We find that the shaping of the mass function by stellar wind mass loss allows us to determine the cluster ages as 3.5 $\pm$ 0.7 Myr and 4.8 $\pm$ 1.1 Myr, respectively. Exploiting the effects of binary mass exchange on the cluster mass function, we find that the most massive stars in both clusters are rejuvenated products of binary mass transfer, i.e., the massive counterpart of classical blue straggler stars. This resolves the problem of an apparent age spread among the most luminous stars exceeding the expected duration of star formation in these clusters. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to probe stochastic sampling, which support the idea of the most massive stars being rejuvenated binary products. We find that the most massive star is expected to be a binary product after 1.0 $\pm$ 0.7 Myr in Arches and after 1.7 $\pm$ 1.0 Myr in Quintuplet. Today, the most massive 9 $\pm$ 3 stars in Arches and 8 $\pm$ 3 in Quintuplet are expected to be such objects. Our findings have strong implications for the stellar upper mass limit and solve the discrepancy between the claimed 150 M &sun; limit and observations of four stars with initial masses of 165-320 M &sun; in R136 and of supernova 2007bi, which is thought to be a pair-instability supernova from an initial 250 M &sun; star. Using the stellar population of R136, we revise the upper mass limit to values in the range 200-500 M &sun;.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We study a sample composed of 28 of the brightest stars in the Arches cluster. Our aim is to constrain their stellar and wind properties and to establish their nature and evolutionary status. Methods: We analyze K-band spectra obtained with the integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the VLT. Atmosphere models computed with the code CMFGEN are used to derive the effective temperatures, luminosities, stellar abundances, mass loss rates and wind terminal velocities. Results: We find that the stars in our sample are either H-rich WN7-9 stars (WN7-9h) or supergiants, where two are classified as OIf+. All stars are 2-4 Myr old. There is marginal evidence for a younger age among the most massive stars. The WN7-9h stars reach luminosities as high as 2 × 106 L&sun;, consistent with initial masses of ~120 M&sun;. They are still quite H-rich, but show both N enhancement and C depletion. They are thus identified as core H-burning objects showing products of the CNO equilibrium on their surface. Their progenitors are most likely supergiants of spectral types earlier than O4-6 and initial masses >60 M&sun;. Their winds follow a well-defined modified wind momentum - luminosity relation (WLR): this is a strong indication that they are radiatively driven. Stellar abundances tend to favor a slightly super-solar metallicity, at least for the lightest metals. We note, however, that the evolutionary models seem to under-predict the degree of N enrichment.  Based on observations collected at the ESO Very Large Telescope (program 075.D-0736(A)).

	Abstract = {We present new high angular resolution near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the nuclear star cluster surrounding the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole. Using the integral-field spectrograph OSIRIS on Keck II behind the laser-guide-star adaptive optics system, this spectroscopic survey enables us to separate early-type (young, 4-6 Myr) and late-type (old, >1 Gyr) stars with a completeness of 50% down to K' = 15.5 mag, which corresponds to ~10 M &sun; for the early-type stars. This work increases the radial extent of reported OSIRIS/Keck measurements by more than a factor of three from 4'' to 14'' (0.16 to 0.56 pc), along the projected disk of young stars. For our analysis, we implement a new method of completeness correction using a combination of star-planting simulations and Bayesian inference. We assign probabilities for the spectral type of every source detected in deep imaging down to K' = 15.5 mag using information from spectra, simulations, number counts, and the distribution of stars. The inferred radial surface-density profiles, Sigma(R)vpropR -Gamma, for the young stars and late-type giants are consistent with earlier results (Gammaearly = 0.93 $\pm$ 0.09, Gammalate = 0.16 $\pm$ 0.07). The late-type surface-density profile is approximately flat out to the edge of the survey. While the late-type stellar luminosity function is consistent with the Galactic bulge, the completeness-corrected luminosity function of the early-type stars has significantly more young stars at faint magnitudes compared with previous surveys with similar depth. This luminosity function indicates that the corresponding mass function of the young stars is likely less top-heavy than that inferred from previous surveys.},

@article{Lu:2013wo,
	Abstract = {The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way plays host to a massive, young cluster that may have formed in one of the most inhospitable environments in the Galaxy. We present new measurements of the global properties of this cluster, including the initial mass function (IMF), age, and cluster mass. These results are based on Keck laser-guide-star adaptive optics observations used to identify the young stars and measure their Kp-band luminosity function as presented in Do et al. A Bayesian inference methodology is developed to simultaneously fit the global properties of the cluster utilizing the observations and extensive simulations of synthetic star clusters. We find that the slope of the mass function for this cluster is alpha = 1.7 $\pm$ 0.2, which is steeper than previously reported, but still flatter than the traditional Salpeter slope of 2.35. The age of the cluster is between 2.5 and 5.8 Myr with 95% confidence, which is a younger age than typically adopted but consistent within the uncertainties of past measurements. The exact age of the cluster is difficult to determine since our results show two distinct age solutions (3.9 Myr and 2.8 Myr) due to model degeneracies in the relative number of Wolf-Rayet and OB stars. The total cluster mass is between 14,000 and 37,000 M &sun; above 1 M &sun; and it is necessary to include multiple star systems in order to fit the observed luminosity function and the number of observed Wolf-Rayet stars. The new IMF slope measurement is now consistent with X-ray observations indicating a factor of 10 fewer X-ray emitting pre-main-sequence stars than expected when compared with a Salpeter IMF. The young cluster at the Galactic center is one of the few definitive examples of an IMF that deviates significantly from the near-universal IMFs found in the solar neighborhood.},

	Abstract = {The study of young stellar populations has revealed that most stars are in binary or higher order multiple systems. In this study, the influence on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of large quantities of unresolved multiple massive stars is investigated by taking into account the stellar evolution and photometrically determined system masses. The models, where initial masses are derived from the luminosity and colour of unresolved multiple systems, show that even under extreme circumstances (100 per cent binaries or higher order multiples), the difference between the power-law index of the mass function (MF) of all stars and the observed MF is small (<~0.1). Thus, if the observed IMF has the Salpeter index alpha = 2.35, then the true stellar IMF has an index not flatter than alpha = 2.25. Additionally, unresolved multiple systems may hide between 15 and 60 per cent of the underlying true mass of a star cluster. While already a known result, it is important to point out that the presence of a large number of unresolved binaries amongst pre-main-sequence stars induces a significant spread in the measured ages of these stars even if there is none. Also, lower mass stars in a single-age binary-rich cluster appear older than the massive stars by about 0.6 Myr.},

	Abstract = {Context. The stellar mass function is a probe for a potential dependence of star formation on the environment. Only a few young clusters are known to reside within the central molecular zone and can serve as testbeds for star formation under the extreme conditions in this region.  Aims: We determine the present-day mass function of the Quintuplet cluster, a young massive cluster in the vicinity of the Galactic centre.  Methods: We use two epochs of high resolution near infrared imaging data obtained with NAOS/CONICA at the ESO VLT to measure the individual proper motions of stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the cluster reference frame. An unbiased sample of cluster members within a radius of 0.5 pc from the cluster centre was established based on their common motion with respect to the field and a subsequent colour-cut. Initial stellar masses were inferred from four isochrones covering ages from 3 to 5 Myr and two sets of stellar evolution models. For each isochrone, the present-day mass function of stars was determined for the full sample of main sequence cluster members using an equal number binning scheme.  Results: We find the slope of the present-day mass function in the central part of the Quintuplet cluster to be alpha = -1.68+0.13-0.09, which is significantly flatter than the Salpeter slope of alpha = -2.35. The flattening of the present-day mass function may be caused by rapid dynamical evolution of the cluster in the strong Galactic centre tidal field. The derived mass function slope is compared to the values found in other young massive clusters in the Galaxy.  Based on observations collected at the ESO/VLT under Program ID 71.C-0344(A) (PI: F.

In the first step, kinematic members of the cluster are identified based on multi-epoch astrometric monitoring. In the second step, a Bayesian analysis is carried out, comparing the observed photometric sequence of cluster members with sets of theoretical isochrones. When applying this methodology to optical and near-infrared high angular resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and adaptive optics observations of the ~5 Myr old starburst cluster Westerlund 1 and ~2 Myr old starburst cluster NGC 3603 YC, we derive upper limits for the age spreads of 0.4 and 0.1 Myr, respectively.

	Abstract = {Westerlund 1 is the most important starburst cluster in the Galaxy due to its massive star content. We have performed BVIC and JKS photometry to investigate the initial mass function (IMF). By comparing the observed color with the spectral-type-intrinsic-color relation, we obtain the mean interstellar reddening of langE(B - V)rang = 4.19 $\pm$ 0.23 and langE(J - KS )rang = 1.70 $\pm$ 0.21. Due to the heavy extinction toward the cluster, the zero-age main sequence fitting method based on optical photometry proved to be inappropriate for the distance determination, while the near-infrared photometry gave a reliable distance to the cluster---3.8 kpc from the empirical relation. Using the recent theoretical stellar evolution models with rotation, the age of the cluster is estimated to be 5.0 $\pm$ 1.0 Myr. We derived the IMF in the massive part and obtained a fairly shallow slope of Gamma = -0.8 $\pm$ 0.1. The integration of the IMF gave a total mass for the cluster in excess of 5.0 × 104 M &sun;. The IMF shows a clear radial variation indicating the presence of mass segregation. We also discuss the possible star formation history of Westerlund 1 from the presence of red supergiants and relatively low luminosity yellow hypergiants.},

	Abstract = {New Technology Telescope (NTT)/Son of Isaac (SOFI) imaging and spectroscopy of the Wolf-Rayet population in the massive cluster Westerlund 1 are presented. Narrow-band near-infrared (IR) imaging together with follow up spectroscopy reveals four new Wolf-Rayet stars, of which three were independently identified recently by Groh et al., bringing the confirmed Wolf-Rayet content to 24 (23 excluding source S) - representing 8 per cent of the known Galactic Wolf-Rayet population - comprising eight WC stars and 16 (15) WN stars. Revised coordinates and near-IR photometry are presented, whilst a quantitative near-IR spectral classification scheme for Wolf-Rayet stars is presented and applied to members of Westerlund 1. Late subtypes are dominant, with no subtypes earlier than WN5 or WC8 for the nitrogen and carbon sequences, respectively. A qualitative inspection of the WN stars suggests that most (~75 per cent) are highly H deficient. The Wolf-Rayet binary fraction is high (>=62 per cent), on the basis of dust emission from WC stars, in addition to a significant WN binary fraction from hard X-ray detections according to Clark et al. We exploit the large WN population of Westerlund 1 to reassess its distance (~5.0kpc) and extinction (AKS ~ 0.96mag), such that it is located at the edge of the Galactic bar, with an oxygen metallicity ~60 per cent higher than Orion. The observed ratio of WR stars to red and yellow hypergiants, N(WR)/N(RSG + YHG) ~3, favours an age of ~4.5-5.0Myr, with individual Wolf-Rayet stars descended from progenitors of initial mass ~40-55Msolar. Qualitative estimates of current masses for non-dusty, H-free WR stars are presented, revealing 10-18Msolar, such that ~75 per cent of the initial stellar mass has been removed via stellar winds or close binary evolution. We present a revision to the cluster turn-off mass for other Milky Way clusters in which Wolf-Rayet stars are known, based upon the latest temperature calibration for OB stars. Finally, comparisons between the observed WR population and subtype distribution in Westerlund 1 and instantaneous burst evolutionary synthesis models are presented.  Based on observations made with ESO telescopes at the La Silla Observatory under programme IDs 073.D-0321 and 075.D-0469.  E-mail: Paul.crowther@sheffield.ac.uk},

	Abstract = {The flow of gas in and around the bars or ovals of modeled barred galaxies is studied, and it is shown that it is intimately linked to the properties of the periodic orbits. Simulations show that the density of the gas in and around the bar region is slow, except for the center and two narrow lanes which are the loci of shocks. Such shocks form if the x1 periodic orbits have either loops or large curvature values at their apocenters. The form of the shock loci depends on the number of parameters characterizing the bar and disk potential. In order for shocks to be offset from the bar major axis toward its leading side, the x2 and x3 families must not only exist but also cover a sufficient extent along the bar major axis. The existence of offset shock loci of the observed shape puts strict constraints on the values the various model parameters may take. For low values of the bar axial ratio or the bar quadrupole moment the shock loci are curved, with their concave sides towards the bar major axis. Substantial inflow is found in models with strong shocks.},

	Abstract = {The Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) millimeter array was used to make observations of the CS (2-1) line (at 97.981 GHz) arising from the G0.07+0.04 region of the ``-30 km s-1'' molecular cloud near the Galactic center, with a spatial resolution of ~8". The ionized edge of this cloud forms the Arched Filaments H II regions, which are ionized by the adjacent Arches stellar cluster. The OVRO data were combined with single-dish data from 1986 obtained at the 30 m IRAM telescope by Serabyn & G{\"u}sten. A comparison of these CS (2-1) data and our recent H92alpha recombination line data reveals that the ionized and molecular gas are physically related, but that their velocities in this region differ by up to 35 km s-1. This difference in velocity can be understood if the gas that gave rise to the G0.07+0.04 H II region has been fully ionized. An overall comparison of the molecular and ionized gas across the entire -30 km s-1 cloud based on the single-dish CS (2-1) data and the H92alpha line data illustrates that such differences in velocity between the ionized and molecular gas are common and that the geometric arrangement of these components is complicated. Much of the ionized gas resides on the near side (to the observer) of the molecular cloud; however, in several regions some molecular material must lie in front of the H II region. The Arches stellar cluster therefore appears to be located in the midst of the molecular cloud, such that some of the near-side cloud surfaces along our line of sight have not been exposed to the ionizing radiation.},

	Abstract = {With the HOPS, MALT90 and HiGAL Galactic plane surveys we are mapping a significant fraction of the dense, star-forming, molecular gas in the Galaxy. I present results from two projects based on this combined dataset, namely, (i) looking for variations in the star formation (SF) rate across the Galaxy as a function of environment, and (ii) searching for molecular cloud progenitors of the most extreme (massive and dense) stellar clusters. We find the SF rate per unit mass of dense gas in the inner 500pc of the Galaxy is at least an order of magnitude lower than that in the disk, directly challenging the predictions of proposed universal column/volume density relations. In particular, the region 1 degrees < l < 3.5 degrees, |b| < 0.5 degrees contains ~1E7 Msun of dense molecular gas -- enough to form 1000 Orion-like clusters -- but the present-day star formation rate within this gas is only equivalent to that in Orion. I present follow up studies of one molecular cloud we have studied as part of project (ii) which also lies in the inner 500 pc of the Galaxy and is clearly extreme compared to the rest of the Galactic population. With a mass of 1E5 Msun,a radius of only ~3pc and almost no signs of star formation it appears to be the progenitor of an Arches-like stellar cluster. Despite detailed observational followup searches, this object still appears to be unique in the Galaxy, making it extremely important for testing massive cluster formation models.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution CO images of the Galactic center region taken with the 2 × 2 focal-plane array receiver mounted on the 45 m telescope of Nobeyama Radio Observatory. We have collected about 44,000 12C16O (J = 1-0) spectra and over 13,000 13C16O (J = 1-0) spectra with a 34" (1.4 pc) grid spacing. The 12CO mapping area is roughly -1.5d <= l <= +3.4d and -0.6d <= b <= +0.6d, which covers almost the full extent of the molecular gas concentration in the Galactic center. These CO images demonstrate extremely complex distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in the Galactic center. While its large-scale behavior can be attributed to the well-known coherent features, bright CO emission arises from a number of compact (d <= 10 pc) clouds with large velocity widths (DeltaV >= 30 km s-1 ). The small-scale structure of molecular gas is characterized by filaments, arcs, and shells. The boisterous molecular gas kinematics there may be a result of violent release of kinetic energy by a number of supernova explosions and/or Wolf-Rayet stellar winds.},

	Abstract = {Star formation in the inner few hundred parsecs of the Galactic bulge occurs in a flattened molecular layer called the central molecular zone (CMZ). It has been suggested that star formation in the CMZ has been sustained for the lifetime of the Galaxy and that the resulting agglomeration of stars formed in the CMZ has resulted in the prominent r-2 stellar density cusp at the Galactic center having about the same physical extent as the CMZ. This ``central cusp'' is somewhat less flat than the CMZ; thus, the population of stars formed in the CMZ appears to have diffused out to larger latitudes. We hypothesize that such vertical diffusion is driven by the scattering of stars off the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the CMZ and perform numerical simulations of the scattering between stars and GMCs in the presence of the nonaxisymmetric background potential. The simulation results show that the timescale for an initially flattened stellar population to achieve an aspect ratio of the observed OH/IR stars in the inner bulge, 1-2 Gyr, agrees well with the estimated age of those OH/IR stars.},

A ring of dense gas clouds forms as a result of X 1-X 2 orbit transfer, and our potential model results in a ring radius of ~200 pc, which coincides with the extraordinary reservoir of dense molecular clouds in the inner bulge, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). The gas clouds accumulated in the CMZ can reach high enough densities to form stars, and with an appropriate choice of simulation parameters, we successfully reproduce the observed gas mass and the star formation rate (SFR) in the CMZ, ~2 × 107 M sun and ~0.1 M sun yr-1. Star formation in our simulations takes place mostly in the outermost X 2 orbits, and the SFR per unit surface area outside the CMZ is much lower. These facts suggest that the inner Galactic bulge may harbor a mild version of the nuclear star-forming rings seen in some external disk galaxies. Furthermore, from the relatively small size of the Milky Way's nuclear bulge, which is thought to be a result of sustained star formation in the CMZ, we infer that the Galactic inner bulge probably had a shallower density profile or stronger bar elongation in the past.},

	Abstract = {We present near-infrared (H- and K-band) integral-field observations of the circumnuclear star formation rings in five nearby spiral galaxies. The data, obtained at the Very Large Telescope with the SINFONI spectrograph, are used to construct maps of various emission lines that reveal the individual star forming regions ("hot spots") delineating the rings. We derive the morphological parameters of the rings, and construct velocity fields of the stars and the emission line gas. We propose a qualitative, but robust, diagnostic for relative hot spot ages based on the intensity ratios of the emission lines Brgamma, He I, and [Fe II]. Application of this diagnostic to the data presented here provides tentative support for a scenario in which star formation in the rings is triggered predominantly at two well-defined regions close to, and downstream from, the intersection of dust lanes along the bar with the inner Lindblad resonance.

@article{Gieles:2006lr,
	Abstract = {We investigate encounters between giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and star clusters. We propose a single expression for the energy gain of a cluster due to an encounter with a GMC, valid for all encounter distances and GMC properties. This relation is verified with N-body simulations of cluster-GMC encounters, where the GMC is represented by a moving analytical potential. Excellent agreement is found between the simulations and the analytical work for fractional energy gains of DeltaE/|E0| < 10, where |E0| is the initial total cluster energy. The fractional mass loss from the cluster scales with the fractional energy gain as (DeltaM/M0) = f(DeltaE/|E0|), where f ~= 0.25. This is because a fraction 1 - f of the injected energy goes to the velocities of escaping stars, that are higher than the escape velocity. We therefore suggest that the disruption time of clusters, tdis, is best defined as the time needed to bring the cluster mass to zero, instead of the time needed to inject the initial cluster energy. We derive an expression for tdis based on the mass loss from the simulations, taking into account the effect of gravitational focusing by the GMC. Assuming spatially homogeneous distributions of clusters and GMCs with a relative velocity dispersion of sigmacn, we find that clusters lose most of their mass in relatively close encounters with high relative velocities (~2sigmacn). The disruption time depends on the cluster mass (Mc) and half-mass radius (rh) as tdis =2.0S(Mc/104Msolar)(3.75pc/rh)3 Gyr, with S ≡ 1 for the solar neighbourhood and S scales with the surface density of individual GMCs (Sigman) and the global GMC density (rhon) as S ~ (Sigmanrhon)-1. Combined with the observed relation between rh and Mc, that is, rh ~ Mlambdac, tdis depends on Mc as tdis ~ Mgammac. The index gamma is then defined as gamma = 1 - 3lambda. The observed shallow relation between cluster radius and mass (e.g. lambda ~= 0.1), makes the value of the index gamma = 0.7 similar to that found from observations and from simulations of clusters dissolving in tidal fields (gamma ~= 0.62). The constant of 2.0 Gyr, which is the disruption time of a 104 Msolar cluster in the solar neighbourhood, is about a factor of 3.5 shorter than that found from earlier simulations of clusters dissolving under the combined effect of Galactic tidal field and stellar evolution. It is somewhat higher than the observationally determined value of 1.3 Gyr. It suggests, however, that the combined effect of tidal field and encounters with GMCs can explain the lack of old open clusters in the solar neighbourhood. GMC encounters can also explain the (very) short disruption time that was observed for star clusters in the central region of M51, since there rhon is an order of magnitude higher than that in the solar neighbourhood.},

@article{Banerjee:2014qm,
	Abstract = {The formation of very young massive clusters or "starburst" clusters is currently one of the most widely debated topic in astronomy. The classical notion dictates that a star cluster is formed in-situ in a dense molecular gas clump followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. On the other hand, based on the observed morphologies of many young stellar associations, a hierarchical formation scenario is alternatively suggested. A very young (age $\approx$ 1 Myr), massive ($>10^4M_\odot$) star cluster like the Galactic NGC 3603 young cluster (HD 97950) is an appropriate testbed for distinguishing between such "monolithic" and "hierarchical" formation scenarios. A recent study by Banerjee and Kroupa (2014) demonstrates that the monolithic scenario remarkably reproduces the HD 97950 cluster. In the present work, we explore the possibility of the formation of the above cluster via hierarchical assembly of subclusters. These subclusters are initially distributed over a wide range of spatial volumes and have various modes of sub-clustering. Unlike the monolithic model that reproduces HD 97950 very well, the same is found to be prohibitive with hierarchical assembly alone. Only those systems which assemble promptly into a single cluster (in $\lesssim1$ Myr) from a close separation (all within $\lesssim2$ pc) could match the observed density profile of HD 97950 after $\approx70$% gas dispersal. These results therefore suggest that NGC 3603 young cluster has formed essentially monolithically, i.e., either in-situ or via a prompt assembly, followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. Both scenarios are consistent with the inferred young age and the small age spread of this cluster. Future observations of molecular cloud filaments with ALMA and proper motion measurements of young clusters with Gaia will provide more direct tests of such birth environments. [Abridged]},

	Abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars that form the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than ˜100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than ˜104M&sun;; the size of the cluster and its environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters. We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

	Abstract = {We recently proposed that the star-forming potential of dense molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central few 100 pc) of the Milky Way is linked to their orbital dynamics, potentially giving rise to an absolute-time sequence of star-forming clouds. In this paper, we present an orbital model for the gas stream(s) observed in the CMZ. The model is obtained by integrating orbits in the observed gravitational potential and represents a good fit to the distribution of dense gas, reproducing all of its key properties. The orbit is also consistent with observational constraints not included in the fitting process, such as the velocities of Sgr B2 and the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. It differs from previous models: (1) the orbit is open rather than closed due to the extended mass distribution in the CMZ, (2) its orbital velocity is twice as high as in previous models, and (3) Sgr A$^*$ coincides with the focus of the (eccentric) orbit rather than being offset. Our orbital solution supports the scenario in which the dust ridge between G0.253+0.016 ('the Brick') and Sgr B2 represents an absolute-time sequence of star-forming clouds, triggered by the tidal compression during their recent pericentre passage. We position the clouds on a common timeline and find that their pericentre passages occurred 0.30-0.74 Myr ago. Given their short free-fall times (0.3-0.4 Myr), the quiescent cloud G0.253+0.016 and the vigorously star-forming complex Sgr B2 are separated by a single free-fall time of evolution, implying that star formation proceeds rapidly once collapse has been initiated. We provide several quantitative predictions of our model and conclude with a discussion of the model in the Galactic context, highlighting its relation to large-scale gas accretion, the dynamics of the bar, the $x_2$ orbital family, and the origin of the Arches and Quintuplet clusters.

	Abstract = {We analyse IRAS and COBE DIRBE data at wavelengths between 2.2 and 240 mu m of the central 500 pc of the Galaxy and derive the large-scale distribution of stars and interstellar matter in the Nuclear Bulge. Models of the Galactic Disk and Bulge are developed in order to correctly decompose the total surface brightness maps of the inner Galaxy and to apply proper extinction corrections. The Nuclear Bulge appears as a distinct, massive disk-like complex of stars and molecular clouds which is, on a large scale, symmetric with respect to the Galactic Centre. It is distinguished from the Galactic Bulge by its flat disk-like morphology, very high density of stars and molecular gas, and ongoing star formation. The Nuclear Bulge consists of an R-2 Nuclear Stellar Cluster at the centre, a large Nuclear Stellar Disk with radius 230+/-20 pc and scale height 45+/- 5 pc, and the Nuclear Molecular Disk of same size. The total stellar mass and luminosity of the Nuclear Bulge are 1.4+/-0.6x 109 Msun and 2.5+/-1x 109 Lsun, respectively. About 70% of the luminosity is due to optical and UV radiation from young massive Main-Sequence stars which are most abundant in the Nuclear Stellar Cluster. For the first time, we derive a photometric mass distribution for the central 500 pc of the Galaxy which is fully consistent with the kinematic mass distribution. We find that the often cited R-2 distribution holds only for the central ~ 30 pc and that at larger radii the mass distribution is dominated by the Nuclear Stellar Disk which has a flatter density profile. The total interstellar hydrogen mass in the Nuclear Bulge is MH=2+/-0.3x 107 Msun, distributed in a warm inner disk with R=110+/-20 pc and a massive, cold outer torus which contains more than 80% of this mass. Interstellar matter in the Nuclear Bulge is very clumpy with ~ 90% of the mass contained in dense and massive molecular clouds with a volume filling factor of only a few per cent. This extreme clumpiness, probably caused by the tidal stability limit in the gravitational potential of the Nuclear Bulge, enables the strong interstellar radiation field to penetrate the entire Nuclear Bulge and explains the relatively low average extinction towards the Galactic Centre. In addition, we find 3x 107 Msun of cold and dense material outside the Nuclear Bulge at positive longitudes and 1x 107 Msun at negative longitudes. This material is not heated by the stars in the Nuclear Bulge and gives rise to the observed asymmetry in the distribution of interstellar matter in the Central Molecular Zone.},

	Abstract = {Recently, more than 100 Wolf-Rayet and OB stars were identified in the Galactic center. About a third of these sources are not spatially associated with any of the known star clusters in this region. We probe the distribution of drifted sources in numerical models of the massive clusters in the Galactic center and compare it to the observed distribution of isolated massive sources in this region. We find that stars as massive as 100 M&sun; drift away from the center of each cluster by up to ~ 60 pc using the cluster models. Our best model reproduces ~ 60% of the known isolated massive stars out to 80 pc from the center of the Arches cluster. This number increases to 70-80% when we only consider the region that is ~ 20 pc from the Arches cluster.},

	Abstract = {We present a new method to detect and quantify mass segregation in star clusters. It compares the minimum spanning tree (MST) of massive stars with that of random stars. If mass segregation is present, the MST length of the most massive stars will be shorter than that of random stars. This difference can be quantified (with an associated significance) to measure the degree of mass segregation. We test the method on simulated clusters in both 2D and 3D and show that the method works as expected.  We apply the method to the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and show that the method is able to detect the mass segregation in the Trapezium with a `mass segregation ratio (MSR)' LambdaMSR = 8.0 +/- 3.5 (where LambdaMSR = 1 is no mass segregation) down to 16Msolar, and also that the ONC is mass segregated at a lower level (~2.0 +/- 0.5) down to 5Msolar. Below 5Msolar we find no evidence for any further mass segregation in the ONC.},

	Abstract = {We present deep Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 photometry of the young HD 97950 star cluster in the giant H II region NGC 3603. The data were obtained in 1997 and 2007 permitting us to derive membership based on proper motions of the stars. Our data are consistent with an age of 1 Myr for the HD 97950 cluster. A possible age spread, if present in the cluster, appears to be small. The global slope of the incompleteness-corrected mass function for member stars within 60'' is Gamma = -0.88 $\pm$ 0.15, which is flatter than the value of a Salpeter slope of -1.35. The radially varying mass function shows pronounced mass segregation ranging from slopes of -0.26 $\pm$ 0.32 in the inner 5'' to -0.94 $\pm$ 0.36 in the outermost annulus (40''-60''). Stars more massive than 50 M &sun; are found only in the cluster center. The Lambda minimum spanning tree technique confirms significant mass segregation down to 30 M &sun;. The dependence of Lambda on mass, i.e., that high-mass stars are more segregated than low-mass stars, and the (weak) dependence of the velocity dispersion on stellar mass might imply that the mass segregation is dynamical in origin. While primordial segregation cannot be excluded, the properties of the mass segregation indicate that dynamical mass segregation may have been the dominant process for segregation of high-mass stars.},

	Abstract = {We study the evolution of the mass function in young and dense star clusters by means of direct N-body simulations. Our main aim is to explain the recent observations of the relatively flat mass function observed near the centre of the Arches star cluster. In this region, the power-law index of the mass function for stars more massive than about 5-6 Msolar is larger than the Salpeter value by about unity, whereas further out, and for the lower mass stars, the mass function resembles the Salpeter distribution. We show that the peculiarities in the Arches mass function can be explained satisfactorily without primordial mass segregation. We draw two conclusions from our simulations: (i) the Arches initial mass function is consistent with a Salpeter slope down to ~1Msolar, and (ii) the cluster is about half-way towards core collapse. The cores of other star clusters with characteristics similar to those of the Arches are expected to show similar flattening in the mass functions for the high-mass (>~5Msolar) stars.},

	Abstract = {We have analyzed high-resolution, adaptive optics HK observations of the Arches cluster obtained with NAOS-CONICA. With a spatial resolution of 84 mas, the cluster center is uniquely resolved. From these data, the present-day mass function (MF) of the Arches cluster is derived down to ~4 Msolar. The integrated MF and the core and second-annulus MFs are consistent with a turnover at 6-7 Msolar. This turnover indicates severe depletion of intermediate- and low-mass stars in the Arches cluster, possibly caused by its evolution in the Galactic center environment. The Arches MF represents the first resolved observation of a starburst cluster exhibiting a low-mass-truncated MF. This finding has severe implications for stellar population synthesis modeling of extragalactic starbursts, the derivation of integrated properties such as the total mass of star clusters in dense environments, the survival of low-mass remnants from starburst populations, and chemical enrichment during starburst phases.

	Abstract = {We have analysed high resolution adaptive optics (AO) science demonstration data of the young, massive stellar cluster Arches near the Galactic Center, obtained with the Gemini North telescope in combination with the University of Hawai'i AO system Hokupa'a. The AO H and K' photometry is calibrated using HST/NICMOS observations in the equivalent filters F160W and F205W obtained by Figer et al. (\cite{FKM}). The calibration procedure allows a detailed comparison of the ground-based adaptive optics observations against diffraction limited space-based photometry. The spatial resolution as well as the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the Gemini/Hokupa'a data is comparable to the HST/NICMOS data. The low Strehl ratio of only a few percent is the dominant limiting factor in the Gemini AO science demonstration data as opposed to space-based observations. After a thorough technical comparison, the Gemini and HST data are used in combination to study the spatial distribution of stellar masses in the Arches cluster. Arches is one of the densest young clusters known in the Milky Way, with a central density of ~ 3 x 105 Msun pc-3 and a total mass of about 104 Msun. A strong colour gradient is observed over the cluster field. The visual extinction increases by Delta AV ~ 10 mag over a distance of 15\arcsec from the cluster core. Extinction maps reveal a low-extinction cavity in the densest parts of Arches (R <= 5arcsec ), indicating the depletion of dust due to stellar winds or photo-evaporation. We correct for the change in extinction over the field and show that the slope of the mass function is strongly influenced by the effects of differential extinction. We obtain present-day mass function slopes of Gamma ~ -0.8 +/- 0.2 in the mass range 6 < M < 65 Msun from both data sets. The spatial analysis reveals a steepening of the mass function slope from close to zero in the cluster center to Gamma ~ -1.7 +/- 0.7 at R > 10arcsec , in accordance with a Salpeter slope (Gamma = -1.35). The bias in the mass function towards high-mass stars in the Arches center is a strong indication for mass segregation. The dynamical and relaxation timescales for Arches are estimated, and possible mass segregation effects are discussed with respect to cluster formation models.

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of two well-defined tidal tails emerging from the sparse remote globular cluster Palomar 5. These tails stretch out symmetrically to both sides of the cluster in the direction of constant Galactic latitude and subtend an angle of 2.6d on the sky. The tails have been detected in commissioning data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, providing deep five-color photometry in a 2.5d-wide band along the equator. The stars in the tails make up a substantial part (~1/3) of the current total population of cluster stars in the magnitude interval 19.5<=i*<=22.0. This reveals that the cluster is subject to heavy mass loss. The orientation of the tails provides an important key for the determination of the cluster's Galactic orbit.},

	Abstract = {We have performed a series of N-body simulations to model the Arches cluster. Our aim is to find the best-fitting model for the Arches cluster by comparing our simulations with observational data and to constrain the parameters for the initial conditions of the cluster. By neglecting the Galactic potential and stellar evolution, we are able to efficiently search through a large parameter space to determine, for example, the initial mass function (IMF), size and mass of the cluster. We find that the cluster's observed present-day mass function can be well explained with an initial Salpeter IMF. The lower mass limit of the IMF cannot be constrained well from our models. In our best models, the initial total mass down to a mass limit of 0.5Msolar is (4.9 +/- 0.8) × 104Msolar. The initial virial radius of the cluster is 0.77 +/- 0.12pc. A concentration parameter of the initial King model W0 = 3 gives the best results.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We investigate the validity of the mass segregation indicators commonly used in analysing young stellar clusters.  Methods: We simulate observations by constructing synthetic seeing-limited images of a 1000 massive clusters (104 M_&sun;) with a standard IMF and a King-density distribution function.  Results: We find that commonly used indicators are highly sensitive to sample incompleteness in observational data and that radial completeness determinations do not provide satisfactory corrections, rendering the studies of radial properties highly uncertain. On the other hand, we find that, under certain conditions, the global completeness can be estimated accurately, allowing for the correction of the global luminosity and mass functions of the cluster.  Conclusions: We argue that there is currently no observational evidence of mass segregation in young compact clusters since there is no robust way to differentiate between true mass segregation and sample incompleteness effects. Caution should then be exercised when interpreting results from observations as evidence of mass segregation.},

@article{Gnedin:1997vn,
	Abstract = {We investigate the dynamical evolution of the Galactic globular cluster system in considerably greater detail than has been done hitherto, finding that destruction rates are significantly larger than given by previous estimates. The general scheme (but not the detailed implementation) follows Aguilar, Hut, & Ostriker.  For the evolution of individual clusters, we use a Fokker-Planck code including the most important physical processes governing the evolution: two-body relaxation, tidal truncation of clusters, compressive gravitational shocks while clusters pass through the Galactic disk, and tidal shocks due to passage close to the bulge. Gravitational shocks are treated comprehensively, using a recent result by Kundic & Ostriker that the <DeltaE2> shock-induced relaxation term, driving an additional dispersion of energies, is generally more important than the usual energy shift term <DeltaE>. Various functional forms of the correction factor are adopted to allow for the adiabatic conservation of stellar actions in a presence of transient gravitational perturbation.  We use a recent compilation of the globular cluster positional and structural parameters, and a collection of radial velocity measurements. Two transverse to the line-of-sight velocity components were assigned randomly according to the two kinematic models for the cluster system (following the method of Aguilar, Hut, & Ostriker): one with an isotropic peculiar velocity distribution, corresponding to the present-day cluster population, and the other with the radially preferred peculiar velocities, similar to those of the stellar halo. We use the Ostriker & Caldwell and the Bahcall, Schmidt, & Soneira models for our Galaxy.  For each cluster in our sample, we calculated its orbits over a Hubble time, starting from the present observed positions and assumed velocities. Medians of the resulting set of peri- and apogalactic distances and velocities are used then as an input for the Fokker-Planck code. Evolution of the cluster is followed up to its total dissolution due to a coherent action of all of the destruction mechanisms. The rate of destruction is then obtained as a median over all the cluster sample, in accord with Aguilar, Hut, & Ostriker.  We find that the total destruction rate is much larger than that given by Aguilar, Hut, & Ostriker with more than half of the present clusters (52%-58% for the Ostriker & Caldwell model, and 75%-86% for the Bahcall, Schmidt, & Soneira model) destroyed in the next Hubble time. Alternatively put, the typical time to destruction is comparable to the typical age, a result that would follow from (but is not required by) an initially power law distribution of destruction times. We discuss some implications for a past history of the globular cluster system and the initial distribution of the destruction times, raising the possibility that the current population is but a very small fraction of the initial population with the remnants of the destroyed clusters constituting presently a large fraction of the spheroid (bulge + halo) stellar population.},

The majority of these clusters dissolve within 20 Myr. The general assumption is that clusters are born more or less over this entire density range.  Methods: A new analysis of cluster observations is presented.  Results: It demonstrates that, in fact, clustered star formation works under surprisingly tight constraints with respect to cluster size and density. Conclusions: The observed multitude of cluster densities simply results from snapshots of two sequences evolving in time along pre-defined tracks in the density-radius plane. This implies that the cluster size can actually be used to determine its age.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we use N-body simulations to study the effects of primordial mass segregation on the early and long-term evolution of star clusters. Our simulations show that in segregated clusters early mass loss due to stellar evolution triggers a stronger expansion than for unsegregated clusters. Tidally limited, strongly segregated clusters may dissolve rapidly as a consequence of this early expansion, while segregated clusters initially underfilling their Roche lobe can survive the early expansion and have a lifetime similar to that of unsegregated clusters. Long-lived initially segregated clusters tend to have looser structure and reach core collapse later in their evolution than initially unsegregated clusters. We have also compared the effects of dynamical evolution on the global stellar mass function (MF) of low-mass main-sequence stars. In all cases, the MF flattens as the cluster loses stars. The amount of MF flattening induced by a given amount of mass loss in a rapidly dissolving initially segregated cluster is less than for an unsegregated cluster. The evolution of the MF of a long-lived segregated cluster, on the other hand, is very similar to that of an initially unsegregated cluster.},

	Abstract = {We examine the luminosity and dynamical mass estimates for young massive stellar clusters. For many young (<50 Myr) clusters, the luminosity and dynamical mass estimates differ by a significant amount. We explain this as being due to many young clusters being out of virial equilibrium (which is assumed in dynamical mass estimates) because the clusters are undergoing violent relaxation after expelling gas not used in star formation. We show that, if we assume that luminous mass estimates are correct (for a standard initial mass function), at least 50 per cent of young clusters for which dynamical masses are known are likely to be destroyed within a few tens of Myr of their formation. Even clusters which will retain a bound core may lose a large fraction of their stellar mass. We also show that the core radius and other structural parameters change significantly during the violent relaxation that follows gas expulsion and that they should be considered instantaneous values only, not necessarily reflecting the final state of the cluster. In particular we note that the increasing core radii observed in young LMC/SMC clusters can be well explained as an effect of rapid gas loss.},

	Abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M&sun;. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

	Abstract = {We report results of a large set of N-body calculations aimed to study the evolution of multi-mass star clusters in external tidal fields. Our clusters start with the same initial mass-functions, but varying particle numbers, orbital types and density profiles. Our main focus is to study how the stellar mass-function and other cluster parameters change under the combined influence of stellar evolution, two-body relaxation and the external tidal field. We find that the lifetimes of star clusters moving on similar orbits scale as T sim T_RH^x, where T_RH is the relaxation time, and the exponent x depends on the initial concentration of the cluster and is around x approx 0.75. From the results for the lifetimes, we predict that between 53% to 67% of all galactic globular clusters will be destroyed within the next Hubble time. Low-mass stars are preferentially lost and the depletion is strong enough to turn initially increasing mass-functions into mass-functions which decrease towards the low-mass end. The details of this depletion are insensitive to the starting condition of the cluster. The preferential depletion of low-mass stars from star clusters leads to a decrease of their mass-to-light ratios except for a short period close to final dissolution. The fraction of compact remnants is increasing throughout the evolution and they are more strongly concentrated towards the cluster cores than main-sequence stars. For a sample of galactic globular clusters with well observed parameters, we find a correlation between the observed slope of the mass-function and the lifetimes predicted by us. It seems possible that galactic globular clusters started with a mass-function similar to what one observes for the average mass-function of the galactic disc and bulge. (Abridged)},

	Abstract = {We investigate the dynamical evolution of compact young clusters (CYCs) near the Galactic center (GC) using Fokker-Planck models. CYCs are very young (<5 Myr), compact (<1 pc), and only a few tens of parsecs away from the GC, while they appear to be as massive as the smallest Galactic globular clusters (~104 Msolar). A survey of cluster lifetimes for various initial mass functions, cluster masses, and Galactocentric radii is presented. Short relaxation times due to the compactness of CYCs and the strong tidal fields near the GC make clusters evaporate fairly quickly. Depending on cluster parameters, mass segregation may occur on a timescale shorter than the lifetimes of most massive stars, which accelerates the cluster's dynamical evolution even more. When the difference between the upper and lower mass boundaries of the initial mass function is large enough, strongly selective ejection of lighter stars makes massive stars dominate even in the outer regions of the cluster, so the dynamical evolution of those clusters is weakly dependent on the lower mass boundary. The mass bins for Fokker-Planck simulations were carefully chosen to properly account for a relatively small number of the most massive stars. We find that clusters with a mass <~2×104 Msolar evaporate in <~10 Myr. Two CYCs observed near the GC--the ``Arches cluster'' (G0.121+0.17) and the ``Quintuplet cluster'' (AFGL 2004)--are interpreted in terms of the models; their central densities and apparent ages are consistent with the hypothesis that they represent successive stages of cluster evolution along a common track, with both undergoing rapid evaporation. A simple calculation based on the total masses in observed CYCs and the lifetimes obtained here indicates that the massive CYCs make up only a fraction of the star formation rate (SFR) in the inner bulge estimated from Lyman continuum photons and far-IR observations. This is consistent with the observation that many stars in the inner bulge form outside the large clusters.},

	Abstract = {A massive young star cluster, initially embedded in its parent molecular cloud, will spiral into the Galactic center from <~30m1/26 pc during the lifetime of its most massive stars, if the combined total mass is ~106m6 Msolar. On its way inward, the system loses most of its mass to the strong tidal field, until the dense cluster core of high-mass stars is finally disrupted near the central black hole. A simple model is presented to argue that this scenario may, under plausible conditions, explain the observed location and rotation of the Galactic center He I stars. Accretion of star clusters into the Galactic center could be recurrent and could play an important role in regulating the activity of Sagittarius A*.},

@article{Kim:2000wd,
	Abstract = {We investigate the dynamical evolution of compact young star clusters (CYCs) near the Galactic center using Aarseth's Nbody6 codes. The relatively small number of stars in the cluster (5000-20,000) makes real-number N-body simulations for these clusters feasible on current workstations. Using Fokker-Planck (F-P) models, Kim, Morris, & Lee made a survey of cluster lifetimes for various initial conditions and have found that clusters with a mass <~2×104 Msolar evaporate in ~10 Myr. These results were, however, to be confirmed by N-body simulations because some extreme cluster conditions, such as strong tidal forces and a large stellar mass range participating in the dynamical evolution, might violate assumptions made in F-P models. Here we find that, in most cases, the CYC lifetimes of previous F-P calculations are 5%-30% shorter than those from the present N-body simulations. The comparison of projected number density profiles and stellar mass functions between N-body simulations and Hubble Space Telescope/NICMOS observations by Figer and colleagues in 1999 suggests that the current tidal radius of the Arches cluster is ~1.0 pc and that the parameters for the initial conditions of that cluster are as follows: total mass of 2×104 Msolar and mass function slope for intermediate to massive stars of 1.75 (the Salpeter function has 2.35). We also find that the lower stellar mass limit, the presence of primordial binaries, the amount of initial mass segregation, and the choice of initial density profile (King or Plummer models) do not significantly affect the dynamical evolution of CYCs.},

	Abstract = {We present a database of structural and dynamical properties for 153 spatially resolved star clusters in the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and the Fornax dwarf spheroidal. This database complements and extends others in the literature, such as those of Harris and Mackey & Gilmore. Our cluster sample comprises 50 ``young massive clusters'' in the LMC and SMC, and 103 old globular clusters between the four galaxies. The parameters we list include central and half-light-averaged surface brightnesses and mass densities; core and effective radii; central potentials, concentration parameters, and tidal radii; predicted central velocity dispersions and escape velocities; total luminosities, masses, and binding energies; central phase-space densities; half-mass relaxation times; and ``kappa-space'' parameters. We use publicly available population-synthesis models to compute stellar-population properties (intrinsic B-V colors, reddenings, and V-band mass-to-light ratios) for the same 153 clusters plus another 63 globulars in the Milky Way. We also take velocity-dispersion measurements from the literature for a subset of 57 (mostly old) clusters to derive dynamical mass-to-light ratios for them, showing that these compare very well to the population-synthesis predictions. The combined data set is intended to serve as the basis for future investigations of structural correlations and the fundamental plane of massive star clusters, including especially comparisons between the systemic properties of young and old clusters.  The structural and dynamical parameters are derived from fitting three different models-the modified isothermal sphere of King; an alternate modified isothermal sphere based on the ad hoc stellar distribution function of Wilson; and asymptotic power-law models with constant-density cores-to the surface-brightness profile of each cluster. Surface-brightness data for the LMC, SMC, and Fornax clusters are based in large part on the work of Mackey & Gilmore, but include significant supplementary data culled from the literature and important corrections to Mackey & Gilmore's V-band magnitude scale. The profiles of Galactic globular clusters are taken from Trager et al. We address the question of which model fits each cluster best, finding in the majority of cases that the Wilson models-which are spatially more extended than King models but still include a finite, ``tidal'' cutoff in density-fit clusters of any age, in any galaxy, as well as or better than King models. Untruncated, asymptotic power laws often fit about as well as Wilson models but can be significantly worse. We argue that the extended halos known to characterize many Magellanic Cloud clusters may be examples of the generic envelope structure of self-gravitating star clusters, not just transient features associated strictly with young age.},

	Abstract = {Young massive clusters are as young as open clusters but more massive and compact compared with typical open clusters. The formation process of young massive clusters is still unclear, and it is an open question whether the formation process is the same as typical open clusters or not. We perform a series of $N$-body simulations starting from initial conditions constructed from the results of hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent molecular clouds. In our simulations, both open clusters and young massive clusters form when we assume a density-dependent star formation efficiency. We find that a local star formation efficiency higher than 50 % is necessary for the formation of young massive clusters, but open clusters forms from less dense regions with a local star formation efficiency of $<50$ %. We confirm that the young massive clusters formed in our simulations have mass, size, and density profile similar to those of observed young massive clusters such as NGC 3603 and Trumpler 14. We also find that these simulated clusters evolve via hierarchical mergers of sub-clusters within a few Myr, as is suggested by recent simulations and observations. Although we do not assume initial mass segregation, we observe that the simulated massive clusters show a shallower slope of the mass function ($\Gamma\sim-1$) in the cluster center compared to that of the entire cluster ($\Gamma\sim-1.3$). These values are consistent with those of some young massive clusters in the Milky Way such as Westerlund 1 and Arches.},

	Abstract = {Using recently established empirical calibrations for the impact of chromospheric activity on the radii, effective temperatures, and estimated masses of active low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, we reassess the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) across the stellar/substellar boundary in the Upper Sco star-forming region (age 5-10 Myr). We adjust the observed effective temperatures to warmer values using the observed strength of the chromospheric H$\alpha$ emission, and redetermine the estimated masses of objects using pre--main-sequence evolutionary tracks in the H-R diagram. The effect of the activity-adjusted temperatures is to shift the objects to higher masses by 3-100%. While the slope of the resulting IMF at substellar masses is not strongly changed, the peak of the IMF does shift from ~0.06 to ~0.11 Msun. Moreover, for objects with masses <~0.2 Msun, the ratio of brown dwarfs to stars changes from ~80% to ~33%. These results suggest that activity corrections are essential for studies of the substellar mass function, if the masses are estimated from spectral types or from effective temperatures.},

	Abstract = {The spectral absorption lines in early-type galaxies contain a wealth of information regarding the detailed abundance pattern, star formation history, and stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the underlying stellar population. Using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect of variable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high quality absorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of M31. These data extend to 1 mum and they therefore include the IMF-sensitive spectral features Na I, Ca II, and FeH at 0.82 mum, 0.86 mum, and 0.99 mum, respectively. The models fit the data well, with typical rms residuals <~ 1%. Strong constraints on the IMF and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (M/L)stars, are derived for individual galaxies. We find that the IMF becomes increasingly bottom-heavy with increasing velocity dispersion and [Mg/Fe]. At the lowest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF is consistent with the Milky Way (MW) IMF, while at the highest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF contains more low-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a Salpeter IMF. Our best-fit (M/L)stars values do not exceed dynamically based M/L values. We also apply our models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and find an (M/L)stars that implies fewer low-mass stars than a MW IMF, again agreeing with dynamical constraints. We discuss other possible explanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the IMF is the simplest and most plausible.},

	Abstract = {We study the growth rate of stars via stellar collisions in dense star clusters, calibrating our analytic calculations with direct N-body simulations of up to 65,536 stars, performed on the GRAPE family of special-purpose computers. We find that star clusters with initial half-mass relaxation times <~25 Myr are dominated by stellar collisions, the first collisions occurring at or near the point of core collapse, which is driven by the segregation of the most massive stars to the cluster center, where they end up in hard binaries. The majority of collisions occur with the same star, resulting in the runaway growth of a supermassive object. This object can grow up to ~0.1% of the mass of the entire star cluster and could manifest itself as an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). The phase of runaway growth lasts until mass loss by stellar evolution arrests core collapse. Star clusters older than about 5 Myr and with present-day half-mass relaxation times <~100 Myr are expected to contain an IMBH.},

	Abstract = {Deep Keck/NIRC2 HK'L' observations of the Arches cluster near the Galactic center reveal a significant population of near-infrared excess sources. We combine the L'-band excess observations with K'-band proper motions, which allow us to confirm cluster membership of excess sources in a starburst cluster for the first time. The robust removal of field contamination provides a reliable disk fraction down to our completeness limit of H = 19 mag, or ~5 M sun at the distance of the Arches. Of the 24 identified sources with K' - L'>2.0 mag, 21 have reliable proper motion measurements, all of which are proper motion members of the Arches cluster. VLT/SINFONI K'-band spectroscopy of 3 excess sources reveals strong CO bandhead emission, which we interpret as the signature of dense circumstellar disks. The detection of strong disk emission from the Arches stars is surprising in view of the high mass of the B-type main sequence host stars of the disks and the intense starburst environment. We find a disk fraction of 6% $\pm$ 2% among B-type stars in the Arches cluster. A radial increase in the disk fraction from 3% to 10% suggests rapid disk destruction in the immediate vicinity of numerous O-type stars in the cluster core. A comparison between the Arches and other high- and low-mass star-forming regions provides strong indication that disk depletion is significantly more rapid in compact starburst clusters than in moderate star-forming environments.  Based on observations made with the Keck II telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawai'i, and with ESO Telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under program ID 60.A-9026.},

	Abstract = {We have analyzed H- and Ks-band images of the Arches cluster obtained using the NIRC2 instrument on Keck with the laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS AO) system. With the help of the LGS AO system, we were able to obtain the deepest ever photometry for this cluster and its neighborhood and derive the background-subtracted present-day mass function down to 1.3 Msolar for the 5''-9'' annulus of the cluster. We find that the previously reported turnover at 6 Msolar is simply due to a local bump in the mass function (MF), and that the MF continues to increase down to our 50% completeness limit (1.3 Msolar) with a power-law exponent of Gamma= -0.91 for the mass range of 1.3<M/Msolar<50. Our numerical calculations for the evolution of the Arches cluster show that the Gamma-values for our annulus increase by 0.1-0.2 during the lifetime of the cluster and thus suggest that the Arches cluster initially had Gamma of -1.0 to 1.1, which is only slightly shallower than the Salpeter value.},

@article{Espinoza:2009bs,
	Abstract = {The massive Arches cluster near the Galactic center should be an ideal laboratory for investigating massive star formation under extreme conditions. But it comes at a high price: the cluster is hidden behind several tens of magnitudes of visual extinction. Severe crowding requires space or AO-assisted instruments to resolve the stellar populations, and even with the best instruments interpreting the data is far from direct. Several investigations using NICMOS and the most advanced AO imagers on the ground revealed an overall top-heavy IMF for the cluster, with a very flat IMF near the center. There are several effects, however, that could potentially bias these results, in particular the strong differential extinction and the problem of transforming the observations into a standard photometric system in the presence of strong reddening. We present new observations obtained with the NAOS-Conica (NACO) AO-imager on the VLT. The problem of photometric transformation is avoided by working in the natural photometric system of NACO, and we use a Bayesian approach to determine masses and reddenings from the broad-band IR colors. A global value of Gamma = -1.1 $\pm$ 0.2 for the high-mass end (M > 10 M&sun;) of the IMF is obtained, and we conclude that a power law of Salpeter slope cannot be discarded for the Arches cluster. The flattening of the IMF towards the center is confirmed, but is less severe than previously thought. We find Gamma = -0.88 $\pm$ 0.20, which is incompatible with previous determinations. Within 0.4 pc we derive a total mass of ~2.0($\pm$0.6) × 104 M&sun; for the cluster and a central mass density rho = 2($\pm$0.4) × 105 M&sun; pc-3 that confirms Arches as the densest known young massive cluster in the Milky Way.

	Abstract = {The Galactic center is the most active site of star formation in the Milky Way, where particularly high-mass stars have formed very recently and are still forming today. However, since we are looking at the Galactic center through the Galactic disk, knowledge of extinction is crucial when studying this region. The Arches cluster is a young, massive starburst cluster near the Galactic center. We observed the Arches cluster out to its tidal radius using Ks-band imaging obtained with NAOS/CONICA at the VLT combined with Subaru/CISCO J-band data to gain a full understanding of the cluster mass distribution. We show that the determination of the mass of the most massive star in the Arches cluster, which had been used in previous studies to establish an upper mass limit for the star formation process in the Milky Way, strongly depends on the assumed slope of the extinction law. Assuming the two regimes of widely used infrared extinction laws, we show that the difference can reach up to 30% for individually derived stellar masses and DeltaAKs ~ 1 magnitude in acquired Ks-band extinction, while the present-day mass function slope changes by ~ 0.17 dex. The present-day mass function slope derived assuming the more recent extinction law increases from a flat slope of alphaNishi = -1.50 $\pm$ 0.35 in the core (r < 0.2 pc) to alphaNishi = -2.21 $\pm$ 0.27 in the intermediate annulus (0.2 < r < 0.4 pc), where the Salpeter slope is -2.3. The mass function steepens to alphaNishi = -3.21 $\pm$ 0.30 in the outer annulus (0.4 < r < 1.5 pc), indicating that the outer cluster region is depleted of high-mass stars.

	Abstract = {We present a quantitative spectral analysis of five very massive stars in the Arches cluster, located near the Galactic center, to determine stellar parameters, stellar wind properties, and, most importantly, metallicity content. The analysis uses a new technique, presented here for the first time, and uses line-blanketed non-LTE wind/atmosphere models fitted to high-resolution near-infrared spectra of late-type nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars and OfI+ stars in the cluster. It relies on the fact that massive stars reach a maximum nitrogen abundance that is related to initial metallicity when they are in the WNL phase. We determine the present-day nitrogen abundance of the WNL stars in the Arches cluster to be 1.6% (mass fraction) and constrain the stellar metallicity in the cluster to be solar. This result is invariant to assumptions about the mass-luminosity relationship, the mass-loss rates, and rotation speeds. In addition, from this analysis, we find the age of the Arches cluster to be 2-2.5 Myr, assuming coeval formation.},

@article{Larson:2005sp,
	Abstract = {The thermal properties of star-forming clouds have an important influence on how they fragment into stars, and it is suggested in this paper that the low-mass stellar initial mass function (IMF), which appears to be almost universal, is determined largely by the thermal physics of these clouds. In particular, it is suggested that the characteristic stellar mass, a little below one solar mass, is determined by the transition from an initial cooling phase of collapse to a later phase of slowly rising temperature that occurs when the gas becomes thermally coupled to the dust. Numerical simulations support the hypothesis that the Jeans mass at this transition point plays an important role in determining the peak mass of the IMF. A filamentary geometry may also play a key role in the fragmentation process because the isothermal case is a critical one for the collapse of a cylinder: the collapse and fragmentation of a cylinder can continue freely as long as the temperature continues to decrease, but not if it begins to increase. The limited available results on the dependence of the thermal properties of clouds on metallicity do not suggest a strong dependence of the IMF on metallicity, but the far-infrared background radiation in starburst regions and in the early Universe may significantly shift the peak mass to higher masses in these situations.},

	Abstract = {The constraints on star formation in and near a galactic nucleus are outlined, and the degree of the concentration of massive stellar remnants toward the nucleus is assessed. Within 10-100 parsecs of a galactic nucleus, star formation is strongly affected by the physical extremes of the nuclear region: strong tidal forces, strongly enhanced cloud turbulence and gas heating, and relatively large magnetic fields. Black hole remnants of massive stars will inevitably migrate in the central stellar core of a galaxy and be concentrated there. The radius from which they will sink into the core in the galaxy's lifetime depends on the central mass concentration; for the Milky Way, it is about 4 pc. Close gravitational interactions of stellar remnants with red giants in the central stellar core of the Galaxy occur with sufficient frequency to be important for the evolution of both. The stellar core of the Galaxy is currently bereft of gas, except for the winds emanating from the luminous stellar objects located there.},

	Abstract = {Whether the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is universal or is instead sensitive to environmental conditions is of critical importance: The IMF influences most observable properties of stellar populations and thus galaxies, and detecting variations in the IMF could provide deep insights into the star formation process. This review critically examines reports of IMF variations, with a view toward whether other explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the vast majority were drawn from a universal system IMF: a power law of Salpeter index (Gamma = 1.35) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower power law (Gamma ˜ 0-0.25) for lower mass stars. The shape and universality of the substellar IMF is still under investigation. Observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of most galaxies are also consistent with a universal IMF, suggesting no gross variations over much of cosmic time. Indications of ``nonstandard'' IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments clearly warrant further study. However, there is no clear evidence that the IMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions after the first few generations of stars.},

	Abstract = {Observations of star-forming galaxies at high z have suggested discrepancies in the inferred star formation rates (SFRs) either between data and models or between complementary measures of the SFR. These putative discrepancies could all be alleviated if the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is systematically weighted towards more high-mass star formation in rapidly star-forming galaxies. Here, we explore how the IMF might vary under the central assumption that the turnover mass in the IMF, ?, scales with the Jeans mass in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), ?. We employ hydrodynamic simulations of galaxies coupled with radiative transfer models to predict how the typical GMC Jeans mass, and hence the IMF, varies with galaxy properties. We then study the impact of such an IMF on the star formation law, the SFR-M* relation, sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) and the cosmic SFR density. Our main results are: the H2 mass-weighted Jeans mass in a galaxy scales well with the SFR when the SFR is greater than a few M&sun; yr-1. Stellar population synthesis modelling shows that this results in a non-linear relation between SFR and Lbol, such that SFR ?. Using this model relation, the inferred SFR of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies decreases by a factor of ˜2, and that of high-z SMGs decreases by a factor of ˜3-5. At z˜ 2, this results in a lowered normalization of the SFR-M* relation in better agreement with models, a reduced discrepancy between the observed cosmic SFR density and stellar mass density evolution, and SMG SFRs that are easier to accommodate in current hierarchical structure formation models. It further results in a Kennicutt-Schmidt star formation law with a slope of ˜1.6 when utilizing a physically motivated form for the CO-H2 conversion factor that varies with galaxy physical property. While each of the discrepancies considered here could be alleviated without appealing to a varying IMF, the modest variation implied by assuming ? is a plausible solution that simultaneously addresses numerous thorny issues regarding the SFRs of high-z galaxies.},

@article{Dave:2008kl,
	Abstract = {The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass-star formation rate relationship (M*-SFR) provides key constraints on the stellar mass assembly histories of galaxies. For star-forming galaxies, M*-SFR is observed to be fairly tight with a slope close to unity from z ~ 0 -> 2, and it evolves downwards roughly independently of M*. Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce these trends, broadly independent of modelling details, owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion in these systems. In contrast, the observed amplitude of the M*-SFR relation evolves markedly differently than in models, indicating either that stellar mass assembly is poorly understood or that observations have been misinterpreted. Stated in terms of a star formation activity parameter alphasf ≡ (M*/SFR)/(tHubble-1Gyr), models predict a constant alphasf ~ 1 out to redshifts z ~ 4+, while the observed M*-SFR relation indicates that alphasf increases by approximately three times from z ~ 2 until today. The low alphasf (i.e. rapid star formation) at high z not only conflicts with models, but also difficult to reconcile with other observations of high-z galaxies, such as the small scatter in M*-SFR, the slow evolution of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2-4 and the modest passive fractions in mass-selected samples. Systematic biases could significantly affect measurements of M* and SFR, but detailed considerations suggest that none are obvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution is considered in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) evolves towards more high-mass star formation at earlier epochs. Following Larson, a model is investigated in which the characteristic mass where the IMF turns over increases with redshift. Population synthesis models are used to show that the observed and predicted M*-SFR evolution may be brought into broad agreement if out to z ~ 2. Such IMF evolution matches recent observations of cosmic stellar mass growth, and the resulting z = 0 cumulative IMF is similar to the `paunchy' IMF favoured by Fardal et al. to reconcile the observed cosmic star formation history with present-day fossil light measures.},

To examine this possibility, a calculation of the tidal field of the LMC is included.

	Abstract = {We have compiled a pseudo-snapshot data set of two-colour observations from the Hubble Space Telescope archive for a sample of 53 rich LMC clusters with ages of 106-1010 yr. We present surface brightness profiles for the entire sample, and derive structural parameters for each cluster, including core radii, and luminosity and mass estimates. Because we expect the results presented here to form the basis for several further projects, we describe in detail the data reduction and surface brightness profile construction processes, and compare our results with those of previous ground-based studies. The surface brightness profiles show a large amount of detail, including irregularities in the profiles of young clusters (such as bumps, dips and sharp shoulders), and evidence for both double clusters and post-core-collapse (PCC) clusters. In particular, we find power-law profiles in the inner regions of several candidate PCC clusters, with slopes of approximately -0.7, but showing considerable variation. We estimate that 20 +/- 7 per cent of the old cluster population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has entered PCC evolution, a similar fraction to that for the Galactic globular cluster system. In addition, we examine the profile of R136 in detail and show that it is probably not a PCC cluster. We also observe a trend in core radius with age that has been discovered and discussed in several previous publications by different authors. Our diagram has better resolution, however, and appears to show a bifurcation at several hundred Myr. We argue that this observed relationship reflects true physical evolution in LMC clusters, with some experiencing small-scale core expansion owing to mass loss, and others large-scale expansion owing to some unidentified characteristic or physical process.},

	Abstract = {As a follow-up to our recent study of a large sample of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) clusters, we have conducted a similar study of the structures of 10 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) clusters, using archival Hubble Space Telescope snapshot data. We present surface brightness profiles for each cluster and derive structural parameters, including core radii and luminosity and mass estimates, using exactly the same procedure as for the LMC sample. Because of the small sample size, the SMC results are not as detailed as for the larger LMC sample. We do not observe any post-core-collapse clusters (although we did not expect to), and there is little evidence for any double clusters in our sample. None the less, despite the small sample size, we show for the first time that the SMC clusters follow almost exactly the same trend in core radius with age observed for the LMC system, including the apparent bifurcation at several hundred Myr. This further strengthens our argument that this relationship represents true physical evolution in these clusters, with some developing significantly expanded cores due to an as yet unidentified physical process. Additional data, both observational and from N-body simulations, are still required to clarify many issues.},

	Abstract = {We report a measurement of the streaming motion of the stars in the Galactic bar with the red clump giants (RCGs) using the data of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment II (OGLE-II). We measure the proper motion of 46961 stars and divide RCGs into bright and faint subsamples that on average will be closer to the near and far sides of the bar, respectively. We find that the far-side RCGs (4979 stars) have a proper motion of Delta<mu>~ 1.5 +/- 0.11 masyr-1 toward the negative l relative to the near-side RCGs (3610 stars). This result can be explained by stars in the bar rotating around the Galactic Centre in the same direction as the Sun with vb~ 100 kms-1. In the disc star (DS) and red giant (RG) samples, we do not find significant difference between bright and faint subsamples. For those samples Delta<mu>~ 0.3 +/- 0.14 masyr-1 and ~0.03 +/- 0.14 masyr-1, respectively. It is likely that the average proper motion of RG stars is the same as that of the Galactic Centre. The proper motion of DSs with respect to RGs is ~3.3 masyr-1 toward positive l. This value is consistent with the expectations for a flat rotation curve and solar motion with respect to local standard of rest. RGs have proper motion approximately equal to the average of bright and faint RCGs, which implies that they are on average near the centre of the bar. This pilot project demonstrates that OGLE-II data may be used to study streaming motions of stars in the Galactic bar. We intend to extend this work to all 49 OGLE-II fields in the Galactic bulge region.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model for the gas dynamics in the galactic disc inside the orbit of the Sun. Quasi-equilibrium flow solutions are determined in the gravitational potential of the deprojected COBE near-infrared bar and disc, complemented by a central cusp and, in some models, an outer halo. These models generically lead to four-armed spiral structure between corotation of the bar and the solar circle; their large-scale morphology is not sensitive to the precise value of the pattern speed of the bar, to the orientation of the bar with respect to the observer, or to whether or not the spiral arms carry mass. Our best model provides a coherent interpretation of many observed gas dynamical features. Its four-armed spiral structure outside corotation reproduces quantitatively the directions to the five main spiral arm tangents at |l|<=60 observed in a variety of tracers. The 3-kpc arm is identified with one of the model arms emanating from the ends of the bar, extending into the corotation region. The model features an inner gas disc with a cusped orbit shock transition to an x_2 orbit disc of radius R~150 pc. The corotation radius of the bar is fairly well constrained at R_c~=3.5+/-0.5 kpc. The best value for the orientation angle of the bar is probably 20-25, but the uncertainty is large since no detailed quantitative fit to all features in the observed (l,v) diagrams is yet possible. The Galactic terminal velocity curve from HI and CO observations out to l~=+/-45 (~5 kpc) is approximately described by a maximal disc model with constant mass-to-light ratio for the near-infrared bulge and disc.},

	Abstract = {A coherent picture is constructed of the Galaxy's H I, CO and CS emissions in the region l below 10 deg, b below 0.5 deg. The flow of gas at the Galactic center is dominated by a bar that has corotation at r = 2.4 + or - 0.5 kpc, which is viewed at an angle of 16 + or - 2 deg from its major axis. The first CO emission arises where gas is obliged to switch from x(1) orbits to x(2) orbits, in the notation of Contopoulos. This gives rise to a shock and a clear signature in the (l, v) diagram. The great Galactic center molecular clouds such as Sgr B, are on x(2) orbits. From the structure of the H I terminal velocity envelope, it is deduced that the central mass density scales as rho varies with r to the -1.75 power out to at least about 1.2 kpc along the bar's major axis. Consequently, the circular velocity curve is rising significantly through the radius range where naive analysis of the tangent velocity leads to a falling rotation curve. The great ring of molecular material at r of about 3.5 kpc is probably associated with the bar's outer Lindblad resonance, and the region of low gas densities inward from there with corotation.},

Using a simple toy model, an elliptical shape having semi-major axes of 100 and 60 pc is deduced. The major axis of this 100 pc ring is inclined by about 40$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the plane of the sky and is oriented perpendicular to the major axes of the Galactic Bar. The 100 pc ring appears to trace the system of stable x 2 orbits predicted for the barred Galactic potential. Sgr Asstarf is displaced with respect to the geometrical center of symmetry of the ring. The ring is twisted and its morphology suggests a flattening ratio of 2 for the Galactic potential, which is in good agreement with the bulge flattening ratio derived from the 2MASS data.},

	Abstract = {Super star clusters are the end product of star formation under the most extreme conditions. As such, studying how their final stellar populations are assembled from their natal progenitor gas clouds can provide strong constraints on star formation theories. An obvious place to look for the initial conditions of such extreme stellar clusters is gas clouds of comparable mass and density, with no star formation activity. We present a method to identify such progenitor gas clouds and demonstrate the technique for the gas in the inner few hundred pc of our Galaxy. The method highlights three clouds in the region with similar global physical properties to the previously identified extreme cloud, G0.253 + 0.016, as potential young massive cluster (YMC) precursors. The fact that four potential YMC progenitor clouds have been identified in the inner 100 pc of the Galaxy, but no clouds with similar properties have been found in the whole first quadrant despite extensive observational efforts, has implications for cluster formation/destruction rates across the Galaxy. We put forward a scenario to explain how such dense gas clouds can arise in the Galactic Centre environment, in which YMC formation is triggered by gas streams passing close to the minimum of the global Galactic gravitational potential at the location of the central supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. If this triggering mechanism can be verified, we can use the known time interval since closest approach to Sgr A* to study the physics of stellar mass assembly in an extreme environment as a function of absolute time.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the orbital motion of the Quintuplet cluster near the Galactic center with the aim of constraining formation scenarios of young, massive star clusters in nuclear environments. Three epochs of adaptive optics high-angular resolution imaging with the Keck/NIRC2 and Very Large Telescope/NAOS-CONICA systems were obtained over a time baseline of 5.8 yr, delivering an astrometric accuracy of 0.5-1 mas yr--1. Proper motions were derived in the cluster reference frame and were used to distinguish cluster members from the majority of the dense field star population toward the inner bulge. Fitting the cluster and field proper motion distributions with two-dimensional (2D) Gaussian models, we derive the orbital motion of the cluster for the first time. The Quintuplet is moving with a 2D velocity of 132 $\pm$ 15 km s--1 with respect to the field along the Galactic plane, which yields a three-dimensional orbital velocity of 167 $\pm$ 15 km s--1 when combined with the previously known radial velocity. From a sample of 119 stars measured in three epochs, we derive an upper limit to the velocity dispersion of sigma1D < 10 km s--1 in the core of the Quintuplet cluster. Knowledge of the three velocity components of the Quintuplet allows us to model the cluster orbit in the potential of the inner Galaxy. Under the assumption that the Quintuplet is located in the central 200 pc at the present time, these simulations exclude the possibility that the cluster is moving on a circular orbit. Comparing the Quintuplet's orbit with our earlier measurements of the Arches' orbit, we discuss the possibility that both clusters originated in the same area of the central molecular zone (CMZ). According to the model of Binney et al., two families of stable cloud orbits are located along the major and minor axes of the Galactic bar, named x1 and x2 orbits, respectively. The formation locus of these clusters is consistent with the outermost x2 orbit and might hint at cloud collisions at the transition region between the x1 and x2 orbital families located at the tip of the minor axis of the Galactic bar. The formation of young, massive star clusters in circumnuclear rings is discussed in the framework of the channeling in of dense gas by the bar potential. We conclude that the existence of a large-scale bar plays a major role in supporting ongoing star and cluster formation, not only in nearby spiral galaxies with circumnuclear rings, but also in the Milky Way's CMZ.  This paper is based on observations obtained with the VLT at Paranal Observatory, Chile, under program 71.C-0344 (PI: Eisenhauer) and 081.D-0572(B) (PI: Brandner), and obtained with the Keck telescopes at Mauna Kea, Hawai'i (PI: Morris).},

@article{Clarkson:2012ty,
	Abstract = {We report the first detection of the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the Arches cluster---a young (~2 Myr), massive (104 M &sun;) starburst cluster located only 26 pc in projection from the Galactic center. This was accomplished using proper motion measurements within the central 10'' × 10'' of the cluster, obtained with the laser guide star adaptive optics system at Keck Observatory over a three-year time baseline (2006-2009). This uniform data set results in proper motion measurements that are improved by a factor ~5 over previous measurements from heterogeneous instruments. By careful, simultaneous accounting of the cluster and field contaminant distributions as well as the possible sources of measurement uncertainties, we estimate the internal velocity dispersion to be 0.15 $\pm$ 0.01 mas yr-1, which corresponds to 5.4 $\pm$ 0.4 km s-1 at a distance of 8.4 kpc. Projecting a simple model for the cluster onto the sky to compare with our proper motion data set, in conjunction with surface density data, we estimate the total present-day mass of the cluster to be M(r < 1.0 pc) = 1.5+0.74 -0.60 × 104 M &sun;. The mass in stars observed within a cylinder of radius R (for comparison to photometric estimates) is found to be M(R < 0.4 pc) = 0.90+0.40 -0.35 × 104 M &sun; at formal 3sigma confidence. This mass measurement is free from assumptions about the mass function of the cluster, and thus may be used to check mass estimates from photometry and simulation. Photometric mass estimates assuming an initially Salpeter mass function (Gamma0 = 1.35, or Gamma ~ 1.0 at present, where dN/d(log M)vpropM Gamma) suggest a total cluster mass M cl ~ (4-6) × 104 M &sun; and projected mass (~ 2 <= M(R < 0.4 pc) <= 3) × 104 M &sun;. Photometric mass estimates assuming a globally top-heavy or strongly truncated present-day mass function (PDMF; with Gamma ~ 0.6) yield mass estimates closer to M(R < 0.4 pc) ~ 1-1.2 × 104 M &sun;. Consequently, our results support a PDMF that is either top-heavy or truncated at low mass, or both. Collateral benefits of our data and analysis include: (1) cluster membership probabilities, which may be used to extract a clean-cluster sample for future photometric work; (2) a refined estimate of the bulk motion of the Arches cluster with respect to the field, which we find to be 172 $\pm$ 15 km s-1, which is slightly slower than suggested by previous measurements using one epoch each with the Very Large Telescope and the Keck telescope; and (3) a velocity dispersion estimate for the field itself, which is likely dominated by the inner Galactic bulge and the nuclear disk.},

	Abstract = {The Very Large Array has been used at 8.3 GHz in the DnC and CnB array configurations to carry out an H92alpha recombination line study of the ionized gas in the Arched Filaments H II complex, which defines the western edge of the Galactic center Radio Arc. The Arched Filaments consist of a series of curved filamentary ridges which extend over 9'×6' (22×16 pc) and are intersected in two places by linear, nonthermal, magnetic filaments. The H92alpha observations cover the entire Arched Filaments region using a four-field mosaic, with an angular resolution of 12.8"×8.10" an additional higher resolution (3.6"×2.7") field was imaged in the SW portion of the H II complex. High-resolution continuum images are also presented. The H92alpha line properties of the ionized gas (line-to-continuum ratio, FWHM line width, T*e) are consistent with photoionization from hot stars and consistent with the physical properties of other Galactic center H II regions. The LTE electron temperatures vary only slightly across the entire extent of the source and have an average value of 6200 K. The velocity field is very complex, with velocities ranging from +15 to -70 km s-1 and the majority of velocities having negative values. Large velocity gradients (2-7 km s-1 pc-1, with gradients in some regions larger than 10 km s-1 pc-1) occur along each of the filaments, with the velocities becoming increasingly negative with decreasing distance from the Galactic center. The negative velocities and the sense of the velocity gradients can be understood in terms of the orbital path of the underlying molecular cloud about the Galactic center. The magnitudes of the velocity gradient are consistent with the cloud residing on an inner, elongated orbit which is due to the Galaxy's stellar bar, or with a radially infalling cloud. The ionization of the Arched Filaments can be accounted for completely by the massive Arches stellar cluster, which consists of more than 150 O stars and produces a few ×1051 photons s-1. This cluster is likely to be located 10-20 pc from the Arched Filaments, which can explain the uniformity of ionization conditions in the ionized gas.},

	Abstract = {We present the first measurement of the proper motion of the young, compact Arches cluster near the Galactic center from near-infrared adaptive optics (AO) data taken with the recently commissioned laser-guide star (LGS) at the Keck 10 m telescope. The excellent astrometric accuracy achieved with LGS-AO provides the basis for a detailed comparison with VLT/NAOS-CONICA data taken 4.3 yr earlier. Over the 4.3 yr baseline, a spatial displacement of the Arches cluster with respect to the field population is measured to be 24.0+/-2.2 mas, corresponding to a proper motion of 5.6+/-0.5 mas yr-1 or 212+/-29 km s-1 at a distance of 8 kpc. In combination with the known line-of-sight velocity of the cluster, we derive a three-dimensional (3D) space motion of 232+/-30 km s-1 of the Arches relative to the field. The large proper motion of the Arches cannot be explained with any of the closed orbital families observed in gas clouds in the bar potential of the inner Galaxy, but would be consistent with the Arches being on a transitional trajectory between x1 and x2 orbits. We investigate a cloud-cloud collision as the possible origin for the Arches cluster. The integration of the cluster orbit in the potential of the inner Galaxy suggests that the cluster passes within 10 pc of the supermassive black hole only if its true GC distance is very close to its projected distance. A contribution of young stars from the Arches cluster to the young stellar population in the inner few parsecs of the GC thus appears increasingly unlikely. The measurement of the 3D velocity and orbital analysis provides the first observational evidence that Arches-like clusters do not spiral into the GC. This confirms that no progenitor clusters to the nuclear cluster are observed at the present epoch.},
