# SPISEA: Stellar Population Interface for Stellar Evolution and Atmospheres

SPISEA is an python package that generates single-age, single-metallicity
populations (i.e. star clusters). It gives the user control over many parameters:

* Cluster characteristics (age, metallicity, mass, distance)
* Total extinction, differential extinction, and extinction law
* Stellar evolution and atmosphere models
* Stellar multiplicity and Initial Mass Function
* Initial-Final Mass Relation
* Photometric filters

Here is a brief list of things that SPISEA can do:

* make a cluster isochrone in many filters using different stellar models
* make a star cluster at any age with an unusual IMF and unresolved multiplicity
* make a spectrum of a star cluster in integrated light

See [documentation](https://spisea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for
details on installing and running SPISEA. We also provide jupyter notebooks with a 
[quick-start tutorial](https://github.com/astropy/SPISEA/blob/main/docs/Quick_Start_Make_Cluster.ipynb)
and [additional examples](https://github.com/astropy/SPISEA/tree/main/docs/paper_examples)
demonstrating how to use SPISEA.

If you use SPISEA in your research, please cite [Hosek et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200606691H/abstract).

## Change Log
SPISEA is actively supported and is growing in functionality, and
subsequently has had several updates since its
initial release. See the
[main documentation page](https://spisea.readthedocs.io/en/mist_update/index.html)
for the change log describing each of the updates. 

## Contributions
We welcome and encourage contributions to SPISEA!
 For feature additions, we ask that users make their
own fork of the repository, make their changes, and then submit a pull
request to the "dev" branch.

All contributions will be acknowledged on the
[contributors page](https://spisea.readthedocs.io/en/dev/contributors.html#contributors) (with permission).
Contributors with features used in code releases will be co-authors in future SPISEA software papers.
