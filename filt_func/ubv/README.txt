These are the Johnson-Cousin filters (UBVRI) from this site:

The wavelength is nm, the transmission is a percent.

!!!
NOTE: that the wavelengths are given in decreasing order when you download the textfile from the website. This does not play nicely with the code, so you will manually need to change the wavelengths to be in increasing order. Also, to be safe, get rid of wavelengths that lay outside the Vega range.
